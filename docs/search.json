    "text": "What follows is extensively based on the second chapter of Heterodox Macroeconomics: Models of of Demand, Distribution and Growth (2019) by Robert A. Blecker and Mark Setterfield\n\n2.0.1 Assumptions of the model\nThe classical-marxian model, named after Smith, Ricardo (who are considered as classics) and marx and based on their important work, comes its specific assumptions:\n\nConstant or full capacity rate of utilization.\n\nThe latter, \\(u = \\frac{Y}{Y_{K}}\\), is ratio of the actual output (GDP) divided by the full capacity output \\(Y_K\\), which is the level if output if all capital in the economy was used at its full capacity (no unused machines, raw materials…). If this ratio is equal to one, that means that the economy is at full capacity, the actual output is equal to its capacity level. If the ratio is for example 0.5, that means that actual output is half its level if all capital was fully used. But why does this model make such an assumption? This assumption stands in sharp contrast with the (neo)kaleckian model which typically reverses this assumption stating that capacity rate \\(u\\) is an important adjusting variable.\nBefore explaining the reason behind this assumption, it is necessary to understand the classical-marxian conception of the production process (how inputs, capital and labor, are combined to produce either goods or services), which rests on the Leontieff production function. The latter can be written as\n\\[\nY = min(\\frac{N}{a_0}, \\frac{K}{a_1})\n\\]\nWith N and K respectively labor and capital, \\(a_0 = L/Y\\) the labour-output ratio (the quantity of labour required to produce one unit of ouput) and \\(a_1 = K/Y\\) the quantity of capital required to produce one unit of output (capital-output ratio).\n\n# how to write the leontief production function in R\nleontief &lt;- function(l, k, a0, a1) (min(c(l/a0, k/a1)))\n\n\\(\\frac{N}{a_0}\\) is the maximum output that can be produced with available labour resources while \\(\\frac{K}{a_1}\\) represents maximum output when all capital resources are used.\nFor instance, if three units of labor are required to produce one unit of output and one unit of capital is required to produce one unit of output, what will be produced if we have N = 9 and K = 4 ?\nIn our example, \\(a_0 = 3/1\\) (three units of labor required to produce Y = 1) and \\(a_1 = 1\\) (one unit of capital to produce one unit). We compute \\(N/a_0 = 9/3\\) and \\(K/a_1 = 4/1\\). Since the former \\(9/3 = 3\\) is bigger than \\(4\\), all 9 units of labor will be used to produce 3 units of output. Note that at Y = 3, one unit of capital will be leftover and be unused. In this example, output is “labor-constrained” because it is the amount of labor which is fully used and capital which is not. Output at full employment is \\(Y_N = N/a_0\\).\n\nleontief(l = 9, k = 4, a0 = 3, a1 = 1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nConsidering labor as the constraint is what the (neo)kaleckian model does, while the classical-marxian model considers that capital is the binding constraint on potential output. In the classical-marxian model, all capital is used and thus output is output at full capital utilization \\(Y_K = K/a_1\\).\nWhile both classical-marxian and (neo)kaleckian models use Leontief production function (and are here different from neoclassical models which use cobb-douglas production function), they differ by what they consider as the constraining factor on output: labor for (neo)kaleckian model \\(Y_N\\), capital for classical-marxian model \\(Y_k\\).\nThus, considering that capital is the constraint implies the possibility to consider that the economy can reach a full capacity utilization \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), this is what the classical-marxian model does thus why \\(u\\) is considered constant at full capacity \\(u = 1\\).\n\nConstant and Given Technology\n\nThere is no technological change in the classical-marxian model. However, the effects of exogenous technological change can still be analyzed.\n\n\n2.0.2 Basis of the model\n\n2.0.2.1 Wage-profit trade-off\nThe main equation is derived from the income approach to national income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is the sum of all income sources in the economy. The model makes here other assumptions: no government, closed economy, only workers and capitalists, only one good produced, which are nessecary to write:\n\\[\nPY = WL + rPK\n\\] Which is the national income identity after those assumptions, with \\(P\\) the price, \\(Y\\) the output, \\(W\\) the nominal wage rate, \\(L\\) the amount of labor employed, \\(r\\) the profit rate and \\(K\\) the real stock of capital.\nFrom this equation above is derived one the main equation of the model, the inverse wage-profit relationship:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nw &lt;- function(r) 40 -1*r\n\nggplot(data = tibble(x = 0:10), aes(x = x))+\n  geom_function(fun = w)+\n  annotate(geom = \"label\", x = 7.5, y = 40, label = \"w = 1/a0 - (a1/a0)*r\", color = \"red\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(title = \"Inverse wage-profit relationship\",\n       x = \"profit rate (r)\", y = \"real wage\")\n\n\n\n\nThis equation also implies an inverse relationship between consumption and growth\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\] With \\(c\\) consumption of both workers and capitalist and \\(g\\) the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta{K}/K = I/K\\)\nThese two relationships and hence trade-off between wage and profit, and consumption and growth are the implications of the two main assumptions explained above: constant rate of capacity utilization and given constant technology. Technological change or rise in \\(u\\) can improve the wage-profit trade-off and thus make both profits and wage rate rise (same for consumption-growth trade-off). Graphically, the slope of the curve above would either shift upward or one of the intercept increase.\n\n\n2.0.2.2 Saving function\nThe model makes here another important assumption: all saving is done by the capitalist class. All savings come out from of the profits received by the capitalists. Another important feature is the fact that the classics and Marx did not distinguish between savings and investment (“the purchase of newly produced capital goods, such as machinery, equipment or structures”(p.63)). In C-M terminology, “accumulation” means the mechanistic flow between savings, investment and thus growth. This leads to the “accumulation function”:\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\]\n\\(g \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K\\) (growth \\(g\\) is equal to the investment rate \\(I/K\\) which is the same as saving rate \\(S/K\\)) comes from this non-distinction between saving and investment. \\(s_r\\) is the proportion capitalists save out of their profits \\(r\\). This equation means that growth can increase only with an increase in the saving rate of the capitalists.\n\n\n\n2.0.3 The three equations and the alternative closures\n\n2.0.3.1 3 Equations\nThe basic model is thus based on the three main equations\n\nProfit-wage trade-off\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nConsumption-growth trade-off\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\]\n\nAccumulation function\n\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\] However, the model is not “closed” in the sense that all the main variables (w, r, s_r, g) are endogenous (they all are a function of one another). The model needs thus to be “closed” by adding an exogenous variable. Since the classics and Marx did not give a precise and consistent closure (exogenous variable), the textbook gives four “alternative closures” which come from different interpretation the classics and Marx.\n\n\n2.0.3.2 4 alternative closures\n\nAn exogenously given real wage \\(\\bar{w}\\)\n\nWhich represents an ordinary standard of living for a working-class family. This should not be confounded with the infamous “iron law” of wages (that wages will always tend to go to the subsistence level, this was made popular by Ferdinand Lassalle and Malthus but has nothing to do with Marx and the classics). This exogenous wage rate \\(\\bar{w}\\) is given, but socially and historically determined and varies across countries and time. This is not a natural/physical minium subsistence wage.\n\nExogenous given wage share of national income\n\nThis assumes that wages are determined through a bargaining process in which workers can bargain with capitalists to get wages such as a given wage share of national income is achieved. Note that the wage share can be written as \\(\\psi = wa_0 = w*L/Y\\) and the profit share \\(\\pi = ra_1=rK/Y\\). The real wage \\(w\\) can be written as negatively related to the profit share \\(\\pi\\)\n\\[\nw = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})/a_0 = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})Q\n\\] With \\(Q=Y/L\\) labour productivity.\n\nFull employment or constant employment\n\nThis closures explains that wage depends on the balance between labor demand and supply. Increase in labor demand tend to increase wages whereas the growth in labor supply will tend to decrease wages. A rapid growth of labor demand increase the bargaining power of workers, who can bargain higher wages and conversely when population and labor supply increase rapidly.\nThis closure states that the change in real wage \\(\\hat{w}\\) is a negative function of growth in labour supply \\(n\\)\n\\(\\hat{w} = \\phi(g - n), \\phi'&gt;0\\)\nThus, wage is constant when \\(g = n\\)\nBut then, the manual (on page 71) considers another function, which describes the growth of labor force \\(n\\) as a positive function of real rage \\(w\\), the idea is that the higher wage leads to higher population growth and thus higher labor supply growth:\n\\(n = n_0 + n_1w\\)\n\nA given rate of profit, determined by financial market forces\n\nThe profit rate is determined by the interest rate on loans to firms \\(i\\) and by a risk premium \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\(r = i + \\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.4 Effects of exogenous change\n\n2.0.4.1 Vizualization of the models\n\n\n2.0.4.2 First and second closures\n\n\n\nThe model under first and second closures (exogenous real wage or wage share),Blecker and Setterfield (2019, 69)\n\n\n\n\n2.0.4.3 Third closure\n\n\n\nThird closure: constant of full employment rate, Blecker and Stterfield (2019, 72)\n\n\nSince the fourth closure is in my opinion not really important, I will mostly focus now of those closures above.\n\n\n2.0.4.4 Effects of exogenous change in propensity to save\nWhat happens if the saving propensity out of profits, \\(s_r\\), rise or fall?\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nIf the propsensity to save increase, the accumulation function curve becomes flatter (attention: in the graph above, the y and x axis are inverted on the right quadrant, where the accumulation function is drawn. So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve). Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.\n\n\\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow I/K \\Rightarrow \\nearrow g, \\searrow c\\)\n\nClosure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)\nAn increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and will return at its original level.\nEndogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g, \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow n \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\),\nbut with final g &gt; initial g. Note that under these conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.\nExogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.4.5 Effects of redistribution of income\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nA rise in real wage or wage share would decrease the profit rate (recall the trade-off between wage and profit), which would decrease the growth rate (less is saved and invested since profits decrease). Consumption rises due to the increase in real wage/wage share\n\n\\(\\nearrow \\bar{w} \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow c\\)\nA decrease in real wage or wage share would have the opposite effects.\n\nClosure 3 natural rate of growth\nIn this closure, a change in real wage or wage share would be the effect of an exognous change in population growth (and thus of labor supply). A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the 14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity). The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.\n\n\\(\\nearrow n_0 \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\nearrow c \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.5 Effects of technological change\nThe manual presents four types of technological change:\n\nHarrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change\nLabor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\\)\n\nHicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change\nBoth capital and labor productivity rise\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \\nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\\)\n\nMarx-biased: labor saving, capital using\nLabor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases\nSolow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change\nCapital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged\n\nAll those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise. Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.\n\n2.0.5.1 Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of the rate of profit (FTRP)\nThe FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In Capital Volume III, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a constant rate of exploitation \\(e = s/v\\) with s the surplus value and v the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage share and profit share.\nRecall that the profit share can be written as \\(r = \\pi / a_1\\), if \\(\\pi\\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological change happens, \\(a_1\\) will increase (\\(a_1\\) is the inverse of capital productivity \\(a_1 = K/Y_k\\)). and thus decrease profit rate \\(r\\). Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.\nWhat about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot change: \\(a_0\\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus \\(\\pi = 1-wa_0\\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure, but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share decreases)."

However, the effects of exogenous technological change can still be analyzed.\n\n\n3.0.2 Basis of the model\n\n3.0.2.1 Wage-profit trade-off\nThe main equation is derived from the income approach to national income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is the sum of all income sources in the economy.

So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve). Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.\n\n\\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow I/K \\Rightarrow \\nearrow g, \\searrow c\\)\n\nClosure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)\nAn increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and will return at its original level.\nEndogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g, \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow n \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\),\nbut with final g &gt; initial g. Note that under these conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.\nExogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.4.5 Effects of redistribution of income\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nA rise in real wage or wage share would decrease the profit rate (recall the trade-off between wage and profit), which would decrease the growth rate (less is saved and invested since profits decrease). Consumption rises due to the increase in real wage/wage share\n\n\\(\\nearrow \\bar{w} \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow c\\)\nA decrease in real wage or wage share would have the opposite effects.\n\nClosure 3 natural rate of growth\nIn this closure, a change in real wage or wage share would be the effect of an exognous change in population growth (and thus of labor supply). A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the 14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity). The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.\n\n\\(\\nearrow n_0 \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\nearrow c \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.5 Effects of technological change\nThe manual presents four types of technological change:\n\nHarrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change\nLabor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\\)\n\nHicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change\nBoth capital and labor productivity rise\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \\nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\\)\n\nMarx-biased: labor saving, capital using\nLabor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases\nSolow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change\nCapital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged\n\nAll those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise. Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.\n\n3.0.5.1 Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of the rate of profit (FTRP)\nThe FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In Capital Volume III, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a constant rate of exploitation \\(e = s/v\\) with s the surplus value and v the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage share and profit share.\nRecall that the profit share can be written as \\(r = \\pi / a_1\\), if \\(\\pi\\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological change happens, \\(a_1\\) will increase (\\(a_1\\) is the inverse of capital productivity \\(a_1 = K/Y_k\\)). and thus decrease profit rate \\(r\\). Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.\nWhat about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot change: \\(a_0\\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus \\(\\pi = 1-wa_0\\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure, but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share decreases)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What follows is extensively based on the second chapter of Heterodox Macroeconomics: Models of of Demand, Distribution and Growth (2019) by Robert A. Blecker and Mark Setterfield\n\n3.0.1 Assumptions of the model\nThe classical-marxian model, named after Smith, Ricardo (who are considered as classics) and marx and based on their important work, comes its specific assumptions:\n\nConstant or full capacity rate of utilization.\n\nThe latter, \\(u = \\frac{Y}{Y_{K}}\\), is ratio of the actual output (GDP) divided by the full capacity output \\(Y_K\\), which is the level if output if all capital in the economy was used at its full capacity (no unused machines, raw materials…). If this ratio is equal to one, that means that the economy is at full capacity, the actual output is equal to its capacity level. If the ratio is for example 0.5, that means that actual output is half its level if all capital was fully used. But why does this model make such an assumption? This assumption stands in sharp contrast with the (neo)kaleckian model which typically reverses this assumption stating that capacity rate \\(u\\) is an important adjusting variable.\nBefore explaining the reason behind this assumption, it is necessary to understand the classical-marxian conception of the production process (how inputs, capital and labor, are combined to produce either goods or services), which rests on the Leontieff production function. The latter can be written as\n\\[\nY = min(\\frac{N}{a_0}, \\frac{K}{a_1})\n\\]\nWith N and K respectively labor and capital, \\(a_0 = L/Y\\) the labour-output ratio (the quantity of labour required to produce one unit of ouput) and \\(a_1 = K/Y\\) the quantity of capital required to produce one unit of output (capital-output ratio).\n\n# how to write the leontief production function in R\nleontief &lt;- function(l, k, a0, a1) (min(c(l/a0, k/a1)))\n\n\\(\\frac{N}{a_0}\\) is the maximum output that can be produced with available labour resources while \\(\\frac{K}{a_1}\\) represents maximum output when all capital resources are used.\nFor instance, if three units of labor are required to produce one unit of output and one unit of capital is required to produce one unit of output, what will be produced if we have N = 9 and K = 4 ?\nIn our example, \\(a_0 = 3/1\\) (three units of labor required to produce Y = 1) and \\(a_1 = 1\\) (one unit of capital to produce one unit). We compute \\(N/a_0 = 9/3\\) and \\(K/a_1 = 4/1\\). Since the former \\(9/3 = 3\\) is bigger than \\(4\\), all 9 units of labor will be used to produce 3 units of output. Note that at Y = 3, one unit of capital will be leftover and be unused. In this example, output is “labor-constrained” because it is the amount of labor which is fully used and capital which is not. Output at full employment is \\(Y_N = N/a_0\\).\n\nleontief(l = 9, k = 4, a0 = 3, a1 = 1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nConsidering labor as the constraint is what the (neo)kaleckian model does, while the classical-marxian model considers that capital is the binding constraint on potential output. In the classical-marxian model, all capital is used and thus output is output at full capital utilization \\(Y_K = K/a_1\\).\nWhile both classical-marxian and (neo)kaleckian models use Leontief production function (and are here different from neoclassical models which use cobb-douglas production function), they differ by what they consider as the constraining factor on output: labor for (neo)kaleckian model \\(Y_N\\), capital for classical-marxian model \\(Y_k\\).\nThus, considering that capital is the constraint implies the possibility to consider that the economy can reach a full capacity utilization \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), this is what the classical-marxian model does thus why \\(u\\) is considered constant at full capacity \\(u = 1\\).\n\nConstant and Given Technology\n\nThere is no technological change in the classical-marxian model. However, the effects of exogenous technological change can still be analyzed.\n\n\n3.0.2 Basis of the model\n\n3.0.2.1 Wage-profit trade-off\nThe main equation is derived from the income approach to national income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is the sum of all income sources in the economy. The model makes here other assumptions: no government, closed economy, only workers and capitalists, only one good produced, which are nessecary to write:\n\\[\nPY = WL + rPK\n\\] Which is the national income identity after those assumptions, with \\(P\\) the price, \\(Y\\) the output, \\(W\\) the nominal wage rate, \\(L\\) the amount of labor employed, \\(r\\) the profit rate and \\(K\\) the real stock of capital.\nFrom this equation above is derived one the main equation of the model, the inverse wage-profit relationship:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nw &lt;- function(r) 40 -1*r\n\nggplot(data = tibble(x = 0:10), aes(x = x))+\n  geom_function(fun = w)+\n  annotate(geom = \"label\", x = 7.5, y = 40, label = \"w = 1/a0 - (a1/a0)*r\", color = \"red\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(title = \"Inverse wage-profit relationship\",\n       x = \"profit rate (r)\", y = \"real wage\")\n\n\n\n\nThis equation also implies an inverse relationship between consumption and growth\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\] With \\(c\\) consumption of both workers and capitalist and \\(g\\) the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta{K}/K = I/K\\)\nThese two relationships and hence trade-off between wage and profit, and consumption and growth are the implications of the two main assumptions explained above: constant rate of capacity utilization and given constant technology. Technological change or rise in \\(u\\) can improve the wage-profit trade-off and thus make both profits and wage rate rise (same for consumption-growth trade-off). Graphically, the slope of the curve above would either shift upward or one of the intercept increase.\n\n\n3.0.2.2 Saving function\nThe model makes here another important assumption: all saving is done by the capitalist class. All savings come out from of the profits received by the capitalists. Another important feature is the fact that the classics and Marx did not distinguish between savings and investment (“the purchase of newly produced capital goods, such as machinery, equipment or structures”(p.63)). In C-M terminology, “accumulation” means the mechanistic flow between savings, investment and thus growth. This leads to the “accumulation function”:\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\]\n\\(g \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K\\) (growth \\(g\\) is equal to the investment rate \\(I/K\\) which is the same as saving rate \\(S/K\\)) comes from this non-distinction between saving and investment. \\(s_r\\) is the proportion capitalists save out of their profits \\(r\\). This equation means that growth can increase only with an increase in the saving rate of the capitalists.\n\n\n\n3.0.3 The three equations and the alternative closures\n\n3.0.3.1 3 Equations\nThe basic model is thus based on the three main equations\n\nProfit-wage trade-off\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nConsumption-growth trade-off\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\]\n\nAccumulation function\n\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\] However, the model is not “closed” in the sense that all the main variables (w, r, s_r, g) are endogenous (they all are a function of one another). The model needs thus to be “closed” by adding an exogenous variable. Since the classics and Marx did not give a precise and consistent closure (exogenous variable), the textbook gives four “alternative closures” which come from different interpretation the classics and Marx.\n\n\n3.0.3.2 4 alternative closures\n\nAn exogenously given real wage \\(\\bar{w}\\)\n\nWhich represents an ordinary standard of living for a working-class family. This should not be confounded with the infamous “iron law” of wages (that wages will always tend to go to the subsistence level, this was made popular by Ferdinand Lassalle and Malthus but has nothing to do with Marx and the classics). This exogenous wage rate \\(\\bar{w}\\) is given, but socially and historically determined and varies across countries and time. This is not a natural/physical minium subsistence wage.\n\nExogenous given wage share of national income\n\nThis assumes that wages are determined through a bargaining process in which workers can bargain with capitalists to get wages such as a given wage share of national income is achieved. Note that the wage share can be written as \\(\\psi = wa_0 = w*L/Y\\) and the profit share \\(\\pi = ra_1=rK/Y\\). The real wage \\(w\\) can be written as negatively related to the profit share \\(\\pi\\)\n\\[\nw = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})/a_0 = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})Q\n\\] With \\(Q=Y/L\\) labour productivity.\n\nFull employment or constant employment\n\nThis closures explains that wage depends on the balance between labor demand and supply. Increase in labor demand tend to increase wages whereas the growth in labor supply will tend to decrease wages. A rapid growth of labor demand increase the bargaining power of workers, who can bargain higher wages and conversely when population and labor supply increase rapidly.\nThis closure states that the change in real wage \\(\\hat{w}\\) is a negative function of growth in labour supply \\(n\\)\n\\(\\hat{w} = \\phi(g - n), \\phi'&gt;0\\)\nThus, wage is constant when \\(g = n\\)\nBut then, the manual (on page 71) considers another function, which describes the growth of labor force \\(n\\) as a positive function of real rage \\(w\\), the idea is that the higher wage leads to higher population growth and thus higher labor supply growth:\n\\(n = n_0 + n_1w\\)\n\nA given rate of profit, determined by financial market forces\n\nThe profit rate is determined by the interest rate on loans to firms \\(i\\) and by a risk premium \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\(r = i + \\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.4 Effects of exogenous change\n\n3.0.4.1 Vizualization of the models\n\n\n3.0.4.2 First and second closures\n\n\n\nThe model under first and second closures (exogenous real wage or wage share),Blecker and Setterfield (2019, 69)\n\n\n\n\n3.0.4.3 Third closure\n\n\n\nThird closure: constant of full employment rate, Blecker and Stterfield (2019, 72)\n\n\nSince the fourth closure is in my opinion not really important, I will mostly focus now of those closures above.\n\n\n3.0.4.4 Effects of exogenous change in propensity to save\nWhat happens if the saving propensity out of profits, \\(s_r\\), rise or fall?\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nIf the propsensity to save increase, the accumulation function curve becomes flatter (attention: in the graph above, the y and x axis are inverted on the right quadrant, where the accumulation function is drawn. So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve). Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.\n\n\\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow I/K \\Rightarrow \\nearrow g, \\searrow c\\)\n\nClosure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)\nAn increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and will return at its original level.\nEndogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g, \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow n \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\),\nbut with final g &gt; initial g. Note that under these conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.\nExogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.4.5 Effects of redistribution of income\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nA rise in real wage or wage share would decrease the profit rate (recall the trade-off between wage and profit), which would decrease the growth rate (less is saved and invested since profits decrease).

A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the 14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity). The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.\n\n\\(\\nearrow n_0 \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\nearrow c \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.5 Effects of technological change\nThe manual presents four types of technological change:\n\nHarrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change\nLabor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\\)\n\nHicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change\nBoth capital and labor productivity rise\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \\nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\\)\n\nMarx-biased: labor saving, capital using\nLabor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases\nSolow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change\nCapital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged\n\nAll those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise. Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.\n\n3.0.5.1 Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of the rate of profit (FTRP)\nThe FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In Capital Volume III, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a constant rate of exploitation \\(e = s/v\\) with s the surplus value and v the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage share and profit share.\nRecall that the profit share can be written as \\(r = \\pi / a_1\\), if \\(\\pi\\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological change happens, \\(a_1\\) will increase (\\(a_1\\) is the inverse of capital productivity \\(a_1 = K/Y_k\\)). and thus decrease profit rate \\(r\\). Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.\nWhat about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot change: \\(a_0\\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus \\(\\pi = 1-wa_0\\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure, but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share decreases)."

    "section": "4.1 Roy Harrod: a Model of Unstable Growth",
    "text": "4.1 Roy Harrod: a Model of Unstable Growth\nRoy Forbes Harrod (1900-1978) is an important figure in economics. The British economist is first and foremost known for his formal description of the mechanisms of economic growth, which one of the first attempt to do so in the discipline. As we will see, the conclusion of Harrod’s model is that growth under capitalism is fundamentally unstable.\n\n4.1.1 Three Growth Rates, First and Second Harrod Problems\nHarrod distiguished three growth rates:\n\nThe actual growth rate\nThe rate of growth which is actually observed in the economy \\(y = \\frac{Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t}}\\)\nNatural growth rate\nWhich is defined as \\(y_N = q + n\\), with n the rate of growth of labour and q the rate of growth of labor productivity.\n\nThis rate of growth comes from the definition of ouput at the full-employment level: \\(Y_N = \\frac{N}{a_0}\\) with \\(a_0 = \\frac{N}{Y}\\) the labour-output ratio (how much labour is required per unit of output). The rate of change of \\(Y_N\\) is \\(\\widehat{Y_N} = n - \\widehat{a_0}\\). Since \\(a_0\\) is also the inverse of labour productivity \\(\\frac{1}{a_0} = Y/L\\), \\(-\\widehat{a}\\) is equivalent to labour productivity growth \\(\\widehat{Q} = q\\).\nThis natural rate of growth can be interpreted as an upper limit, the maximum rate of growth that can be achieved in the long run at full employment. The limit comes from the fact that production (output level) is limited by labour supply constraint (since \\(Y_N\\) is the maximum level of output at full-employment).\n\nWarranted rate of growth\nWhich is the rate of growth when investment is equal to savings \\(S = I\\).\n\nHow can we found this third rate of growth? We must first define the investment function (how the model thinks investment decisions are made):\n\\[\nI_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\]\nWith \\(I_t\\) investment at period \\(t\\), \\(a1\\) the full-capacity capital–output ratio (quantity of capital required to produce any given level of output) \\(a_1 = \\frac{K}{Y_K}\\). This ratio can also be interpreted here as the additional quantity of capital needed to produce any additional output (the “at the margins” interpretation). This equation simply means that if agents at time \\(t-1\\) expect output a the next period \\(t\\) to be higher, \\(Y^e_t &gt; Y_{t-1}\\), then investment at the next period \\(t\\) will be equal this this positive difference multiplied by the full-capacity capital–output ratio.\nWhy multiply by \\(a_1\\) ? If we define the actual quantity of capital which is utilized in the economy as \\(K_u = uK\\), \\(u\\) being the full capacity utilization rate \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), we can rewrite the actual quantity of utilized capital as \\(K_u = uK = \\frac{Y}{Y_k}K = a_1Y\\)\nThe change of the amount of capital actually used in the production process is thus \\(\\Delta{K_u} = a_1\\Delta{Y}\\)\nInvestment basically means that new capital is bought and added to the stock of capital available for production: \\(I = \\Delta{K}\\), so that when investment occurs, capital stock increases by \\(\\Delta K\\). If we consider that expectations are realized, \\(\\Delta{Y} = \\Delta{Y^e}\\), we can write\n\\[\nI = \\Delta K = a_1\\Delta Y = \\Delta K_u = a_1\\Delta{Y}\n\\] Thus, \\(a_1\\) is not arbitrary, but conformed to the known quantity of capital required to expand production through investment.\nWe have thus the investment function:\n\\[\nI_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\] The saving function, on the other hand, is equal to:\n\\[\nS_t = sY_t\n\\]\nWith \\(s\\) the propensity to save. This saving function simply means that the total saving is a fixed proportion of total income (production).\nThe last steps to find the warranted rate of growth is to equate the savings and investment function, after making the assumption that expectations are realized:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_t = Y^e_t\n\\\\\nS_t = I_t\n\\\\\ns_tY = a_1(Y_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\\\\n\\frac{s}{a_1} = \\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe warranted rate of growth is thus\n\\[y_w = \\frac{s}{a_1}\\]\nTo sum up, the three rates of growth are\n\nActual Growth Rate\n\n\\(y = \\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\\)\n\nNatural Growth Rate\n\n\\(y_n = q + n\\)\n\nWarranted Growth Rate\n\n\\(y_w = \\frac{s}{a_1}\\)\n\n\n4.1.2 The First Harrod Problem\nThe first Harrod problem states that there is no mechanisms that would ensure a persistent or non-accidental equality between the three growth rates, thus the equality\n\\[\ny = \\frac{s}{a_1} = \\bar{q} + \\bar{n}\n\\] is possible, but as the manual puts it, not likely. The reason is that what influences the warranted rate of growth and the natural rate of growth are independent of each other.\n\n\n4.1.3 The Second Harrod Problem\nThe second Harrod problem states that the warranted rate of growth \\(y_w = s/a_1\\) is unstable. That means that any deviation of the rate of growth from the warranted rate will be self-reinforcing.\nTo see this, we start with the equality between savings and investment:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nI = S\n\\\\\nI_t = sY_t\n\\\\\nY_t = \\frac{I_t}{s}\n\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen by substituting \\(I_t\\) by the investment function \\(I_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\\):\n\\[\nY_t = \\frac{a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})}{s} = \\frac{Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}}{y_w}\n\\] Note that here \\(a_1/s\\) is the inverse of the warranted rate of growth \\(y_w\\), this is why \\(y_w\\) appears at the denominator. If we divide both sides of the equation above by the expected rate of growth \\(Y^e_t\\), we get:\n\\[\\frac{Y_t}{y^e_t} = \\frac{y^e}{y_w}\\]\n\\(y^e\\) comes from the fact that we divided \\(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}\\) by \\(Y^e_t\\), which is the rate of growth of expected growth rate. This equation above simply shows that, if expectations are realized (\\(Y_t = Y^e_t\\), this is a condition for the warranted rate of growth), and \\(y^e = y_w\\), then we have an equilibrium between the actual growth rate and warranted growth rate\n\\[y^e = y = y_w\\]\nThe second Harrod problem explains that any deviation of \\(y\\) from \\(y_w\\) will be self-reinforcing. If \\(y&lt;y_w\\), there will be a downwards pressure on \\(y\\), thus a persistent recession. Conversely, if \\(y&gt;y_w\\), there will be an upwards pressure on \\(y\\), hence a self-reinforcing economic expansion.\nThese mechanisms are the results of how the model conceive the change of the expected growth rate \\(y^e_t\\). If at period \\(t\\) the growth rate \\(y_t\\) is greater than the expected growth rate \\(y_t&gt;y^e_t\\), then at period \\(t+1\\) agents will revise their expected growth rate upward \\(y^e_{t+1} &gt; y^e_t\\). This simple behavioral principle can be summarized as:\n\\[y_t &gt; y^e_t \\Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} &gt;y^e_t\\]\n\\[y_t &lt; y^e_t \\Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} &lt;y^e_t\\]\n\n\n\nInstability of the Warranted rate of Growth\n\n\nThe graph above shows that any deviation from the equilibrium point, at which \\(y_w = y = y^e\\) will lead either to permanent boom or bust. Note that the second Harrod problem depends on how expectations are revised: here we consider expectations as adaptive: expectations will be based on what happened at the previous period.\n\n\n4.1.4 Interactions between actual, warranted and natural growth rates\nTwo scenarios can be considered.\nFirst, when \\(y_w&lt;y_N\\), the economy will be prone to boom and bust behavior. If the actual growth rate is greater than the warranted growth rate, the former will be ever-increasing until the economy will “overheat” when the actual growth rate is superior to the natural rate (which is an upper limit above which there will be exhaustion of labor force and a likely wage-inflation spiral).\nSecond, if \\(y_w&gt;y_N\\), the economy is in a situation of chronic depression. Since the actual growth rate cannot be permanently equal to the warranted rate in this situation (because of the upper limit \\(y_N\\)), the actual rate of growth would tend to permanently fall until government policies would likely start to intervene.\nFinally, this model has consequence for economic policy. Increasing the saving propensity \\(s\\) to boost growth is not a good idea if it is not accompanied by a rise in aggregate demand, in which case increased saving means reduced consumption demand and investment demand is not guaranteed to offset the fall in consumption."

The main difference is the fact that the early Kaldorian model (EKM) includes the saving propensity out of wages \\(s_w\\) whereas the classical-marxian model only includes savings out of profits.\nRecall that the classical-marxian saving function was\n\\(S/K= s_r(r-r_min)\\)\nThe EKM introduces savings out of wages, with a propensity lower than savings out of profits. Total savings is thus a weighted average bewteen savings out of wages and profits:\n\\[S = [(1-\\pi)s_w+\\pi s_r]Y\\]\n\\(\\pi\\) is the profit share, \\((1-\\pi)\\) the wage share, with \\(0&lt;s_w &lt; s_r&lt;1\\).\n\n\n4.2.2 EKM Assumptions\nThe model makes some assumptions, which are globally similar to the C-M model:\n\nEKM assumes that labor productivity is constant \\(q=0\\), hence the natural rate of growth is simply \\(y_N=n\\).\nLike the Classical-Marxian model, growth rate is the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta K/K\\).\nFull or constant capacity rate of utilization \\(u\\)\nConstancy and exogenous capital-output and labor-output ratios \\(a_0,a_1\\)\n\nTo maintain full employment, capital accumulate rate must grow the same as the investment rate and labor supply growth rate:\n\\(g = \\frac{I}{K} = n\\)\n\n\n4.2.3 EKM Equilibrium\nAs usual, we equate \\(S = I\\), to find the equilibrium:\n\\[g = n = \\frac{I}{K} = \\frac{S}{K} = \\frac{[(1-\\pi)s_w+\\pi s_r]Y}{K} = \\frac{(s_r-s_w)\\pi + s_w}{a_1}\\]\nThe equilibrium profit share is thus\n\\[\\pi^* = \\frac{a_1 n - s_w}{s_r - s_w}\\]\nAnd the equilibrium growth rate is\n\\[g^* = n = \\frac{s^*}{a_1}\\]\nA major difference with the C-M model is that instead of considering an exogenous wage share or real wage and deriving the profit rate and growth rate from it, Kaldor set the growth rate equal to its natural rate and derive the profit/wage share and saving propensity necessary to reach this equilibrium. For the EKM to work, wage and profit shares must be flexible, there must be active government stabilization policies (fiscal & monetary).\nEKM has the implications that for the economy to grow faster only with higher inequality."

    "text": "4.3 Neo-Robinsonian Model\nThe major point of this model is to introduce a separation between investment and savings. All the models we saw until now did not distinguish between savings and investment (as the classical-marxian model).\n\n4.3.1 Separating Savings from Investment\nThe main equations of the model are thus a saving function out of profits and a desired investment as a positive function of expected profits.\n\nSaving function\n\n\\[\\sigma = s_rr\\] With \\(\\sigma\\) savings.\n\nDesired investment function\n\n\\[g = f(r^e)\\]\n\\(g\\) being investment. This function is assumed to have positive but diminishing marginal impact of expected profits on desired investment (\\(f'&gt;0, f''&lt;0\\)).\n\n\n\nRobinson “banana diagram”\n\n\nPoint A on the graph above is a stable equilibrium whereas point B is an unstable one. The graph has to be read as follows: at \\(r_0\\) the saving rate is smaller than the (desired) growth rate \\(g_0\\). At \\(g_0\\), the corresponding profit rate is \\(r_1\\), which is above the profit rate related to actual saving rate (\\(r_0\\)). Firms have thus invested in way that will make profits rise and they will thus revise their profits expectations upwards: at \\(r_1\\) they will invest at a level slighlty above \\(g_0\\), which will again push up the profit rate until point A, at which \\(g=\\sigma\\) is reached.\nOn the other hand, if we start at any profit rate below point B, the desired rate of investment will lead to a growth rate that will lead in return to a lower profit rate, firms will revise their profit rate expectations downwards and thus reduce their desired rate of investment, which will then lead to an even lower growth and profit rates and so on. Below point B, this process does not end automatically, there must be for example government stabilization. Above point A, however, the process is the same as described above in this paragraph, but it stabilizes at point A. Note that what happens below point B is strongly similar to the second Harrod problem.\n\n\n4.3.2 Connecting Neo-Robinsonian Model with Wage-Profit Relationship\nThe Neo-Robinsonian model combines the model above with the inverse wage-profit relationship we saw in the C-M model. The desired investment rate is simplified to\n\\(g = f_0+f_1r^e\\)\nWith the same saving function \\(\\sigma = s_rr\\) and the inverse profit-wage relationship \\(w =\\frac{1-a_1 r}{a_0}\\)\nTo find the equilibrium levels of growth, profit and wage rates, we set investment equals to savings \\(\\sigma = g\\) and solve for:\n\\[r^* = \\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1}\\]\nand\n\\[g^*=\\frac{s_rf_0}{s_r-f_1}\\]\nand\n\\[w^* = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0}(\\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1})\\]\nNote that in this model the real wage and wage share are flexible, but nominal wage is not.\n\n\n\nNeo-robinsonian model\n\n\nIn this model, an increase in the propensity to save leads to lower equilibrium level of growth and profit rates and a higher equilibrium real wage. The mechanism is that an increase in the propensity to save, with an unchanged desired investment curve (which means that saving propensity increases without changing firms’ willingness to invest), reduces aggregate demand through a reduction in consumption demand. With falling demand, profits realized from actual investment expenditures also fall.\n\n\n\nEffect of an increase in saving propensity\n\n\nGraphically, the saving curve rotates down to the right. Why does the real wage increase? Recall that in this model, nominal wage is fixed. A change in real wage must then come from a change in the price level. In the case of higher propensity to save, the latter has depressed aggregate demand and growth, which reduces the price level \\(\\searrow P\\).\nWhat if we consider a shift in the desired investment curve? An exemple would be a rise in \\(f_0\\), which can be interpreted as the level of confidence of firms: the higher their confidence in the economy, the higher they will invest for every level of expected profit rates. A rise in \\(f_0\\) would shift the desired investment curve \\(g = f_0+f_1r\\) to the right, profit rate would rise, growth rate would rise, but real wage would decrease. Real wage decreases because inflation increases as a result of higher aggregate demand and thus excess demand in the goods market. Note that inflation in the Neo-robinsonian model is always “demand-pushed”, that is, led by excess or lower demand in the market for goods and services."

Marglin’s contribution was to consider that workers bargain for nominal wages rather than the real wage or wage share.\nMarglin’s synthesis add two functions, which model the change in nominal wage and price level.\n\n4.4.1 Change in nominal wage\n\\(\\hat{W} = \\Omega (\\bar{w} - w)\\)\nWith \\(\\bar{w}\\) the target real wage for workers and \\(\\Omega\\) a constant describing how fast change in nominal wage adjusts to the difference between the target real wage and the real wage \\((\\bar{w} - w)\\). If the target real wage is greater than the actual real wage, workers are willing and are able to bargain for higher wages.\n\n\n4.4.2 Change in price\n\\(\\hat{P} = \\Phi (g^d-g)\\)\nWith\n\\(g^d = f_0 + f_1r\\) (assuming \\(r^e = r\\))\nThe desired investment function, which means that the desired investment rate (\\(g^d\\)) is a positive function of the profit rate (assumed to be equal to the expected rate).\nAnd\n\\(g = s_rr\\)\nThe saving function, which is also a positive function of profit rate.\nThus, \\(\\hat{P} = \\Phi (g^d-g)\\), means that inflation (persistent change in price level: \\(\\hat{P}\\)) is always the result of excess demand in the goods market, excess demand due to the fact that \\(g^d&gt;g\\), demand related to investment (demand for tools, machinery, equipment…).\nThis price level change equation captures an important assumption of the neo-keynesian models that inflation is always “demand-led”, that is, led by excessive demand in the goods market. Another assumption is the constancy of the capital to full capacity output ratio \\(a_1\\) (constant technology).\n\n\n4.4.3 Dynamics of the Model\nThe equilibrium condition of the model, which will determine growth, real wage and profit rate, is the equality between price change and nominal wage change:\n\\[\\widehat{W} = \\widehat{P}\\]\n\n\n\nMarglin’s Classical-Marxian - NeoRobinsonian synthesis\n\n\nAt this equilibrium, the real wage \\(W/P\\) is constant. The other variables behave as such:\n\nIf the target real wage increase \\(\\bar{w}\\), equilibrium profit rate decreases, real wage increases, growth rate decreases and equilibrium inflation increases.\nIf \\(f_0\\), firms’ confidence in the economy, increases, equilibrium inflation increases, equilibrium profit rate and growth rate also increase and equilibrium real wage decreases.\nIf the propensity \\(s_r\\) to save increases, equilibrium profit rate and inflation decrease, but the impact on growth is ambiguous: on the one hand growth is constrained by available savings (and thus if savings increase growth can increase) but on the other hand, growth can also decrease because of the fall in profit rate.\n\nAn important contribution of this model is to make explicit the argument about inflation, which was only implicit in the previous neo-keynesian models (Robinson, Kaldor…). An crucial point is that the model assumes that inflation is always driven by demand (excess demand in the goods market). A critic adressed to this model is that inflation is not only “demand-pull” but can also be “cost-push”, that is, driven positively by an increase in firms’ markups due to an increase in costs.\nAnother critic concerns that inflation caused by the difference between \\(g^d&gt;g\\) is not very realistic because it implies that firms will always want to invest at a rate they cannot achieve."

    "text": "4.1 Intro\nMichał Kalecki (1899-1970) was a Polish economist and major figure of heterodox economics. He made important contributions in macroeconomics and political economy, and his work represents a crucial legacy for a lot of contemporary heterodox economics.\nThe models that will be presented here are related to the macroeconomics of Kalecki. However, it is important to keep in mind that Kalecki also developed a theory of political business cycles (I talk shortly about this theory here). What will be presented here (based on the manual) is just one part of the many important contributions of Kalecki to this discipline.\nThe Neo-Kaleckian model is actually posterior to Kalecki (hence “Neo”), but heavily based on his work. It was developed by Kaleckian economists in the 70s and 80s based on Kalecki work, but also on the work of Josef Steindl (1912-1993), an austrian post-keynesian economist who was a close collegue of Kalecki.\nUntil now, almost all the models I summarized in my heterodox economics series, the classical-marxian models (CMMs) and the Neo-Keynesian models (NKMs), explain that more rapid growth can only be achieve at the expense of a more unequal distribution of income. In other words, the CMM and NKM explain that increasing the rate of growth implies more inequality through either lower real wage or lower wage share.\nOne major flaw of the CMM and NKM is that they either don’t incorporate the important role of aggregate demand in the analysis (in the case of the CMMs) or only partially incorporate it (for the NKMs). Why is it important to take aggregate demand into account when one wants to analyze the determinants of economic growth? Before answering this question, let’s first define aggregate demand.

Because any increase in demand gives impetus to economic expansion: the higher the demand for goods and services, the more firms will want to respond by producing more.\nThe (neo)-kaleckian models are thus very important among heterdox models of economic growth, because it the former incorporates the role of aggregate demand and its impact on growth, even in the long run."

    "section": "4.2 Main characteristics of the model",
    "text": "4.2 Main characteristics of the model\n\n4.2.1 Capacity rate of utilization\nThe main difference of the Neo-Kaleckian model with the CMMs and NKMs is that the Neo-Kaleckian model does not make the assumption that the capacity rate of utilization is fixed, constant, or constant at full level \\(u = 1\\). But what is the rate of capacity utilization already?\nThe rate of capacity utilization \\(u\\) is the ratio of actual output \\(Y\\) to the full-capacity output \\(Y_k\\), which is the output level when all capital is used in the economy. The capacity rate can be thus written as\n\\[u = \\frac{Y}{Y_k}\\] If we consider, as the CMMs and NKMs, that \\(u = 1\\), we simply say that \\(Y = Y_k\\). In other words, \\(u = 1\\) means that all capital is used in the production process in the economy. If, for instance, \\(u = 0.5\\), that means that actual output is only half of what it could be if all capital was used in production.\nA major characteristics of the Neo-Kaleckian model is that the model considers that the capacity rate \\(u\\) is flexible and not equal to one: the level of output is thus never at its full capacity level, contrary to the previous models presented in the manual.\n\n4.2.1.1 3 Reasons why u&lt;1\nWhy does the Neo-Kaleckian model has such a conception of the capacity rate? There are three main reasons for which firms do not operate at full capacity (full utilization of capital).\n\nIndivisibilities\nFirms tend to purchase capital goods (machinery, raw materials, tools…) which can be obtained only in large and discontinuous units, and thus can be operated at less than 100 per cent of their potential.\nBuilding ahead of demand\nSince firms do not know and cannot know what the demand for their products will be in the future (fundamental uncertainty of the future), they will hold excess capacity (excess capital not used in production) in case if demand rise in the future. If firms did not hold excess capacity and if demand suddenly happened to rise, they would not be able to respond by increasing production.\nEntry deterrence\nMost large firms operate in a non-competitive (great number of competitive firms) framework, in which only a few large oligopolistic firms compete in the market. In this situation, these large firms will hold excess capacity as a weapon in case if new firms (new entrants) would want to enter the market as producers and compete with the established firms. Having excess capacity allows established firms to be able to rise production immediately and thus push price downwards to crush any potential new competitors.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Prices as markups over costs\nIn most models described until now, none of them had a precise model/equation describing how prices are set by firms. The Neo-Kaleckian as an explicit and precise definition of how prices are set. Recall that in the context of perfect competition, standard economic theory tells that prices are the result of the equilibrium between demand and supply. In the Neo-Kaleckian framework, markets are not perfectly competitive and firms have what economics call “market power”, that is, the power to influence prices and thus set the latter.\nHow will firms then set prices in the Neo-Kaleckian model? The manual presents the following price equation:\n\\[P = (1 + \\tau)Wa_0\\]\nWhich means that a firm will increase price \\(P\\) if it decides to rise its markup rate \\(\\tau\\), or if nominal wage increase \\(W\\) (since nominal wage is a cost for the firm, note that here other costs are ignored for simplicity and only labor costs are taken into account), or if \\(a_0 = \\frac{L}{Y}\\), the labor/output ratio increases. Here, \\(Y\\) refers to the output produced by the firm and \\(L\\) the amount of labor employed by the firm.\nWhat will influence change in the markup rate \\(\\tau\\)? Kalecki and the manual give five main factors which will influence the markup (a + or - sign is added next to each factor to indicate whether it rises the markup or decreases it):\n\nIndustrial concentration (+)\nThe fewer the firms are in competition with each other, the less the market is competitive and the more firms have market power to increase prices through an increase in their markup.\n‘Overheads’ or fixed costs (+)\nBy these overhead and fixed costs, we mean all the costs associated with machinery and equipment, management, maintenance (overhead labor), Research & Development expenses, intellectual property rights costs or debt service expenses. All these costs are taken into account by firms, which want to set price with a markup over these costs. If these costs increase, firms will also want to increase the markup to set a prices bringing enough revenues.\nSales effort (+)\nWhen firms operate under an oligopolistic framework (few firms, low competition between firms), adverstising is important to increase the number of consumers. Moreover, adverstising is also useful for ’product differentiation”, that is, convincing consumers that the firm’s products are different than the other products offered in the market. Consumers would then be more disposed to consume the differentiated product at a higher price. Advertising is thus both a way to increase the number of consumers and a way to increase oligopolistic market power.\nStrength of labour unions (-)\nIf workers within a firm have enough bargaining power, they may are able to capture parts of the firms’s potential profits. The degree of power workers can have depend on the existence and strength of labor unions: the more labor unions there are and the stronger and more well-organized and powerful they are, they more firms will have to share their value added, and thus decrease their markups.\nExternal competition (-)\nThe more national firms are in competition with the rest of the world, the more competitive pressure they have to lower their price, and thus their markup.\n\n\n\n4.2.3 New wage-profit relationship\nAs with the CMMs, we start with the definition of national income under the income approach: national income is the sum of capitalists and workers’ income (profits and wages, ignoring depreciation, no government, only one good):\n\\[PY = WL + rPK\\] Dividing by \\(PY\\), we get a new inverse wage profit relationship:\n\\[w = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0} \\frac{r}{u}\\]\nThis equation is almost the same as the one we derived in the classical-marxian models. Since the CMMs assumed a full and constant capacity rate of utilization \\(u = 1\\), it does not appear in their wage-profit equation. However, \\(u\\) appears here in the denominator of the \\(r/u\\) fraction because it is assumed to be inferior to one (below full capacity) and flexible. In the equation above, wage appears to be a positive function of \\(u\\), but this is misleading since \\(u\\) and profit rate \\(r\\) are not independent of each other, meaning that if one of the two variables increases, the other will change as well, leaving an ambiguous impact on real wage \\(w\\)."

Stated simply, market equilibrium tells what will be the price of any object or service, as long as the latters are commodified. Market equilibrium explains not only the equilirbium level of prices and commodities of any good or service, but also the change in prices resulting from exogenous shocks (change in income, confidence, technology…)\nLet’s directly take an example: suppose that the demand for grain follows a negative linear function.\n\\(Q_{demand} = 7-0.5p\\)\nThat means that the quantity demanded for grains decreases if the price for grain increases and vice and versa.\nMoreover, let’s say that the quantity supplied for grains is a positive linear function of prices for grain: the higher the price, the more are firms willing to supply grains.\n\\(Q_{supply} = 1+0.6p\\)\n\ndemand &lt;- function(p) 7 - (0.5*p)\nsupply &lt;- function(p) 1 + 0.6*p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the equilibrium price and quantity, we equate the demand and supply functions and solve for q:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{demand} = 7- 0.5*p\n\\\\\nq_{supply} = 1 + 0.6*p\n\\\\\nq_{demand} = q_{supply}\n\\\\\n7 - 0.5*p = 1 + 0.6*p\n\\\\\n6-0.11p = 0\n\\\\\np^* = 6/1.1 = 5.45\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe equilibrium price level is thus \\(p^* = 5.45\\). To find the equilibrium quantity, we simple put the value of the equilibrium price (5.45) into either the supply or demand function: \\(7-0.5*5.45 = 4.275 = p^*\\)\nIt is easy to check directly if the computation is correct in r:\n\nequilibrium &lt;- curve_intersect(demand, supply, empirical = FALSE, domain = c(1,10))\nequilibrium\n\n$x\n[1] 5.454545\n\n$y\n[1] 4.272727\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how did neoclassical theory arrive to this kind of model of equilibrium price and quantity determination? To understand better this model, we need to know why we have this positive supply curve and this negative demand curve. We will first investigate consumer choice theory, which is behind the negative demand curve, and then production-side theory, which is behind the positive supply curve."

    "text": "1.2 Neoclassical-mainstream consumer choice theory\nMainstream consumer choice theory has for ambition to explain consumers’ decision, that is to say, the choices consumers make between consuming one good or another.\n\n1.2.1 The three assumptions\nConsumer theory makes important assumptions, which are the foundation of the theory:\n\nCompleteness:\nconsumers have complete knowledge about the goods and services they can potentially consume, they have clear preferences about these goods and services and can rank all of them (like a descending list where we would have the most preferred goods and services at the top and utility associated with goods and services would decrease as we go down in the list)\nTransitivity:\nPreferences regarding goods and services are transitive. That means that if a consumer prefers A to B and B to C, A is better than C.\nMore is better than less\n(non satiety assumption): Goods and services are always desirable. For example, if someone gives you one apple, then two, then three, then twenty, and then one thousands, you would always accept those apples, because you are still better off even if one gives you too many apples.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Utility function, marginal utility\nConsumer theory then illustrates any choice between two goods with the help of the famous indifference curves , which show the relation between the demand for one good against the demand for another good (for example food and clothes, cars and bikes…). Indifference curves are based on utility functions whose really important property and assumption is the decreasing marginal utility principle. Decreasing marginal utility means that for every one additional unit of a given good a consumer get, the utility for this consumer increases less than the previous additional unit. Let’s say, for instance, that you don’t have food at the moment and you are hungry: if i give you one apple, you will be a lot better off and your utility will increase a lot when I give you this one apple. Then, if I give you another apple, your utility will still increase, but by less than when I gave you the first apple. Finally, after I give you an additional apple for the fifteenth time, your additional utility will still be positive, but by far more less than when I gave you the first apple.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecreasing marginal utility is an important assumption which explains the shape of the indifference curves. The latter, if the two goods are substitutes (but not perfect substitute) and not perfect complements, are convex-shaped. If, for instance, we consider an indifference curve for the choice between units of apples and bikes, the line of the indifference curve represents all the possible combination of the two goods which give the same utility for the consumer.\n\n\n1.2.3 Indifference curve\nIndifference curves are based on utility functions. An utility function can be for example:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU(x,y)=x^20.18y\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] With x and y two different goods, apples and watches for example. To get the indifference curve function, we fix utility U at any positive value, and rearrange the function above to get y as a function of x and U:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU = x^20.18y\n\\\\\ny = \\frac{U}{0.18*x^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nYacas vector:\n[1] y == U/(0.18 * x^2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Budget constraint\nIn the indifference curve graph above, the consumer can choose any combination of apples and watches on the line, and those combinations would bring the same utility U = 10. However, one important element was not taken into account yet. This element is the fact that consumers are limited in their consumption decisions by their income. Neoclassical theory calls this budget constraint. For instance, let’s say that our consumer has an income of 600 francs. The price of one apple is 4 francs (one bag of apples to be more realistic) whereas the price of a watch is 200 francs. The budget constraint can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nIncome = P_{apple}*Q_{apple} + P_{watch}*Q_{watch}\n\\\\\n600 = 4*apple + 200*watch\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo include this budget constraint into the previous graph, we have to rearrange this equation to have the quantity of apples as a function of the quantity of books:\n$$\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n600 = 4*apple + 200*watch\n\\\\\n4apple = 600 - 200watch\n\\\\\napple = 600/4 - 200/4*watch\n\\\\\napple = 150 - 50*watch\n\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n$$ More generally, the budget function can also be written as\n\\[\nQ_1 = \\frac{Income}{P_1} - \\frac{P_2}{P_1}Q_2\n\\]\n\nbudget &lt;- function(x) 150 - 50*x\n\nNow we can plot both the indifference curves and the budget constraint:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe budget line represents all the combination of apples and watches that the consumer can afford with his income. This implies that is final choice has to be on this line. The consumer cannot afford to be on the U = 90 indifference curve because its income is not large enough. Also, he will not choose any point on U = 10 because the latter’s majority of point are on the left of the budget line (the assumption of more is better than less would not be respected if the consumer for instance chooses 1 watch and 50 apples, because he can afford more of the two goods).\nSo what will be the consumer’s final choice? He will choose the point at which the budget constraint line is tangent to one of his indifference curve.\nMathematically, this means that the quantity of apples and watches the consumer will choose is the point at which the slope of the budget line \\(\\frac{P_{watch}}{P_{apples}}\\) is equal to the slope of the indifference curve, which microeconomics call the marginal rate of substitution. Marginal rate of substitution shows how much of a good (here apples) the consumer can give up in exchange of one unit of the other good (here a watch). Using algebra, we can find the slope of the budget line and of the indifference curve by computing their derivatives.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\napple = 150 - 50*watch\n\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial{apple}}{\\partial{watch}} = -50\n\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that finding the marginal rate of substitution is a bit trickier than for the budget line. To find the MRS, we have to compute the derivative with respect to the first good (x which are apples here) and then for the second one (y the watches). Then, the MRS is the ratio between the two marginal utilities \\(\\frac{\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{x}}}{\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{y}}}\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU = x^20.18y\n\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{x}} = 0.36xy\n\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{y}} = 0.18*x^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Thus\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nMRS = \\frac{0.36xy}{0.18x^2} = 2\\frac{y}{x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here is how to compute this in R\nThen, we set the marginal rate of substitution equal to the slope of the budget line:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2\\frac{y}{x} = 50\n\\\\\ny = 25x\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We can then substitute y with 25x in the budget equation\n$$\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ny = 150 - 50*x\n\\\\\n25x = 150 -50x\n\\\\\nx = 150/75 = 2\n\\\\\nx = 2\n\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n$$\nThe optimal solution for x (quantity of watch) is thus 2, the consumer will choose 2 watches. Now that know the quantity of watches, we can obtain the quantity of apples as well as how much utility this combination of apples and watches will bring to the consumer.\nTo get the number of apples, we simply replace x by 6 in the budget constraint equation \\(y = 150-50*2 = 50\\), \\(U = 2^2*50*0.18 = 36\\)\nR can check the results\n\nprice_x = 200\nprice_y = 4\nSolve(paste(Simplify(mu_x / mu_y), \"==\", price_x, \"/\", price_y), y)\n\nYacas vector:\n[1] y == -(-9 * x/0.36)\n\n\n\noptimal_x &lt;- uniroot(function(x) budget(x) - marginal_utility(x), c(0, 100))$root\noptimal_y &lt;- budget(optimal_x)\noptimal_u &lt;- utility_u(optimal_x, optimal_y)\n\n\noptimal_x\n\n[1] 2\n\noptimal_y\n\n[1] 50\n\noptimal_u\n\n[1] 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Deriving the downward slopping demand curve from indifference curve and budget constrain\nThe final step to grasp why micro theory draws downwards slopping demand curve is to see how a change in relative prices \\(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\) changes the consumer’s optimal choice for a good (the equilibrium point in the last graph). In our example, the optimal quantity choice of watch for the consumer was 2 (2 watches costing 200 francs each). What happends in the graph above if the price of watch increases?\nThe budget constraint will change. Initially we have\n\\(apple = 150 - 50watch\\)\nAnd now, the price of watch increases up to 400, income is unchanged (Income = 600) as well as the price of apples (4):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n600 = 4*apple + 400watch\n\\\\\n4apple = 600-400watch\n\\\\\napple = 150 - 100watch\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the new equilibrium level, utility has decreased to 9, apple consumption remains unchanged and the quantity of watches has decreased to one. Note that there are two important mechanisms behind the graph above:\n\nIncome effect Income effect relates to how the demand for a good change when income changes. If the demand increases when income increases, micro talks about positive income effect (and conversely negative income effect). In our example, the consumer’s income has not changed (600 francs), but the real income has decreased, because the price of one the good has increased. The consumer has thus a lower (real) income, which led to a decrease in the quantity demanded for the good whose price increased.\nSubstitution effect Substitution effect refers to how the demand for a good change when the relative price of the good changes.\n\nIncome and substitution effects depend on the type of the good. There are indeed different types of goods, depending on how demand changes when price changes:\n\nNormal good\nA good is normal when demand increases when its price decreases vice and versa\nInferior good\nA good is inferior when the demand decreases as income increases or the price increases\nGiffen good\nA Giffen good refers to goods whose demand increases when price increases. The logic behind this are the goods which are very essential to every day living (for example staple food): an increase in the price of very essential food can lead to the consumer’s decision of reducing the consumption of other goods to still afford consuming the essential good.\n\nThis is how microeconomics derive the demand curve. We will see below that the supply curve is also derived with the same logic, the steps being almost the same as we saw here, but by replacing the utility function with a production function and replacing the two goods by capital and labour, which are the factors of production of any firm."

    "section": "3.2 How firms produce in neoclassical-mainstream theory",
    "text": "3.2 How firms produce in neoclassical-mainstream theory\nNeoclassical production theory has a very specific way to conceive production. In fact, the theory considers that production, how firms or productive units transform inputs (of labour, raw materials or other intermediary inputs/materials/services) into output (final goods or services produced), can be modeled as what is now famously known as the neoclassical production function. The latter is written as:\n\\(Y = F(K,L)\\)\nWith Y the output, the quantity produced, K the quantity of capital used and L the quantity of labour employed. From now on, we will work with the following neoclassical production function as an example:\n\\(Y = K^{1/2}L^{1/2}\\)\nHere is how to write this function in R:\n\nneo_prod_fun &lt;- function(l, k) (l^(1/2)) * (k^(1/2))\n\nThe neoclassical production function rests on important assumptions which illustrate how neoclassical theory conceive the production process:\n\nConstant returns to scale\nConstant returns to scale means that quantities produced increase proportionally with the quantity of inputs. For instance, if the quantities of inputs (capital and labour) are doubled, output will double.\nPositive but diminishing marginal returns\nAlso called diminishing marginal products, or decreasing marginal productivity. This means that all factors of production (capital and labor) show positive but diminishing marginal returns: when we increase one of the inputs by one, with all the other inputs fixed, output will increase, but by less than the previous additional input. For example, the quantity of capital is often considered fixed in the short run, making labor the only variable input in the short run. Labor is assumed to have a decreasing marginal productivity (or marginal returns): with capital fixed, each time a firm employs an additional laborer, output will increase, but by less than when the previous additional laborer was employed. In our example, marginal product of labour is the first derivative with respect to labour:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial{Y}}{\\partial{L}} = 0.5K^{0.5}L^{0.5-1}\n\\\\\n= 0.5K^{0.5}L^{-0.5}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Here is how to find the marginal productivity of labor function of our example in R:\n\nMPL &lt;- Deriv(neo_prod_fun, \"l\")\nMPL\n\nfunction (l, k) \n0.5 * (sqrt(k)/sqrt(l))\n\n\nIf we fix the amount of capital to any value, 10 and 25 for instance, we can plot the marginal productivity of labour to better illustrate the principle of diminishing marginal returns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubstitutability of factors/inputs\nThis third assumption implies that there is an infinite choice bewteen capital and labour for each level of output. For example, to produce 20 units of output, firms have an infinite choice to combine labour and capital. This is a strong assumption and as we will see the “rival” of the neoclassical production function is the Leontief production function, which is also called the “fixed-proportion” production function, because it assumes that for each level of output, there is only one possible combination of capital and labour.\n\nNote that in the standard neoclassical production model makes the assumption that firm operate under perfect competition: perfect competition has three important characteristics:\n\nPrice taking\nSince there are a lot of consumers and firms in the market, firms have not impact on the price, they cannot manipulate the latter. Price is thus exogenous and given.\nProduct homogeneity\nThe good produced in the market by the firms is the same, it is homogenous.\nFree entry and exit\nThere are no special costs associated with the entry in the market for any potential firm nor costs associated with exit (a firm that would want to exit the market)."

    "text": "3.5 Isoquant and Isocost\nIsoquants are a way to represent graphically any combination of labour and capital for any level of ouput. Capital is typically plotted on the y axis and labour on the x axis and output is fixed along each curve. If we go back to our production function curve \\(Y = k^{0.5}L^{0.5}\\), we have to isolate k to draw isoquants for this function, and then choose any value of output (Y):\n\\(K = \\frac{Y^{2}}{L}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in consumer theory, firms cannot choose any combination of capital and labour they want because, as consumers face a budget constraint, firms also face a constraint: their total cost. The isocost line, which shows all possible combinations of labour and capital that the firm can purchase with its current budget, hence total cost. Isocost is for the firm what the budget constraint line is to consumers.\nThe isocost function can be written as:\n\\(TC = wl +rK\\)\nWith TC the total cost being equal to the wage (rate) w times labour L and r the rental cost of capital K. r includes the depreciation cost of capital and the lost interest rate (if the capital was invested somewhere else).\nIsocost can then be rearranged to:\n\\(K = TC/r - (w/r)/L\\)\nFor example, let’s say that the total cost over rental cost of capital (TC/r) is equal to 40 and the wage rate - rental rate is equal to 2 (w/r = 2). The function becomes \\(K = 10 - 2L\\)\n\nisocost &lt;- function(l) 40 - 2*l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe steps to derive the optimal choice of output, capital and labor is the same than for consumer theory: here the slope of the isoquant is called the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS). Setting the latter equal to the slope of the isocost, which is w/r (1 in our example) and solving for K, Y and L. In our example, the equilibrium level of output is 14.14, with K = 20 and L = 10."

    "text": "3.6 Profit equation and profit maximisation\nThe neoclassical production function we saw above is not only important because it models how neoclassical firms produce, but also because it is part of the profit equation that firms want to maximize (in neoclassical theory, firms maximize their profits as consumers maximize their utility). The profit equation is written as:\n\\(\\pi = PQ - TC\\)\nor more generally\n\\(\\pi(q) = R(q) - TC(q)\\)\nWith \\(\\pi\\) the profits of the firm, \\(PQ\\) the price P multiplied by the quantity produced Q, minus the total cost TC. We saw above that total cost was equal to \\(TC = wL -rK\\), but micro manuals sometimes simplify this by just stating that total cost is equal to variable cost and fixed cost (in the short run, because in the long run all factors are variable).\nTwo important concepts are linked to this profit equation: marginal revenue and marginal cost.\n\nMarginal revenue is the change in revenue resulting from from a one-unit increase in output.\nMarginal cost is the change in cost associated with a one-unit increase in output\n\nIn perfect competition, marginal revenue is determined outside the firm, the latter having no influence on it because it has no power to manipulate the price. Marginal revenue is in fact the market price of the good produced by the firm and it is exogenous in a perfectly competitive market. On the other hand, marginal cost is inherent to the firm because it depends on the level of output chosen by the firm.\nMathematically, marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue of the firm \\(P*Q\\) and is equal to the market price \\(P\\). Marginal cost is the derivative of total cost, but marginal cost is not the same whether we are in the short of the long run. In the short run, only labour is variable, so the marginal cost is the additional increase in cost associated with a one-unit labour increase (an additional labourer)\n\\(MC = \\frac{\\Delta{VC}}{\\Delta{}{}Q} = \\frac{w\\Delta{}{}L}{\\Delta{Q}}\\)\nBut in the long run, marginal cost is the additional cost resulting from an additional increase of any input \\(MC = \\frac{\\Delta{TC}}{\\Delta{Q}}\\). Algebraically, marginal cost is the derivative of total cost (long run) or variable cost (short run).\nThen, neoclassical production theory explains that the profit equation \\(\\pi = PQ - TC\\) has a concave form. The logic behind this is the fact that the theory considers that firms have increasing economies of scale at low level of production and, as output increases, economies of scale will gradually decrease and become negative (economies of scale at the beginning and the diseconomies of scale at some point).\n\nEconomies of scales\nWhen output can be increased for less than proportionnaly increasing the cost. For instance if output is doubled, cost less than double. Neoclassical theory typically considers that for low level of output (small firms), economies of scale are more likely because of productivity gains due to\n\nspecialization,\nreorganization of the production process and\nbargaining power for some intermediary inputs (advantage of buying in bulk).\n\nDiseconomies of scales\nWhen output is increased, cost more than proportionnaly increase. For instance, if output is doubled, cost more than double. Neoclassical theory considers that diseconomies of scale arrive at some point for high level of ouput because of:\n\nLack of space in the factory/working place ==&gt; more difficult to do the job\nIncreasing number of tasks ==&gt; management becomes more difficult due to increasing complexity of tasks\nThe advantage of buying in bulk disappears when certain quantity level is reached.\n\n\nThose factors explain why the profit equation is concave. This has strong implications, because that means there is an optimal size for the firm associated with an optimal level of output which maximise profits.\nThen, we can show that profit maximization under all of those conditions lead to the marginal cost being equal to marginal revenue\n\\((\\pi)' = 0\\) (()’ meaning derivative)\n\\(0 =(PQ)' - (TC)'\\) the derivative of total revenue is the marginal revenue, and the derivative of the total cost is the marginal cost\n\\(0 =MR - MC\\)\n\\(MR = MC\\)\nGraphically, the profit equation has a negative-concave shape, and optimal level of output is set where profits are at their maximum:"

And why the quantities supplied increase with the price of the good?\nMicro theory tells that the supply curve represents all the combinations of price and output (quantity of the good supplied) in which the price is higher than the average variable cost. If the market price is below the average variable cost (AVC), supplying the good would not be profitable. If the price is higher than AVC, it is profitable for the firm to produce (and the firm will supply the quantity at which its marginal revenue, the price, is equal to the marginal cost). Then, if price increases, marginal revenue increases, and firms can increase production and quantity supplied until marginal revenue is again equal to the marginal cost."

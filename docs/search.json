Most of the content and macro models presented here are summaries of Blecker and Setterfield (2019) manual on heterodox macroeconomics. I created this website simply because I need a platform to put all my notes and summaries from my economics classes during my studies, so that I can have a quick access to it and also make it accessible to anyone interested in the topic.\n\n\n\n\nBlecker, Robert A., and Mark Setterfield. 2019. Heterodox Macroeconomics: Models of Demand, Distribution and Growth. Cheltenham, UK ; Northampton, MA, USA: Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd."

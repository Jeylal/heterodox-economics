    "text": "1.1 Market equilibrium\n\n1.1.1 What is a market?\nMarket equilibrium is perhaps the most important element of neoclassical theory. Every introductory mainstream textbooks start with market equilibrium. Acemoglu, Laibson, and List (2017) defines a market as:\n“A group of economic agents who are trading a good or service plus the rules and arrangements for trading” (Acemoglu, Laibson, and List 2017, 59).\nThe definition given by Pindyck and Rubinfeld (2013) is more precise:\n“Market: Collection of buyers and sellers that, through their actual or potential interactions, determine the price of a product or set of products” (Pindyck and Rubinfeld 2013, 8).\nStated simply, market equilibrium tells what will be the price of any object or service, as long as the latter are turned into commodities. Market equilibrium explains not only the equilibrium level of prices and commodities of any good or service, but also the change in prices resulting from exogenous shocks (change in income, confidence, technology…).\nA market is thus a place (material or not) where an object or service turned into a commodity is offered by suppliers and demanded by consumers and thus traded when an agreement is reached over the price which will determine the value of the traded commodity.\n\n\n1.1.2 Markets under perfect competition\nBut there are many types of markets. Microeconomics generally starts with an ideal-type market: the perfectly competitive market. The latter refers to any market in which there are a large number of suppliers as well as large number of consumers. An important characteristic of perfectly competitive markets is that suppliers and consumers think that they cannot manipulate or have an influence over the market price. Market price is thus considered as given and fixed by the market when demand equates supply, as we will see below.\n\n\n1.1.3 Demand, Supply, Equilibrium\nConsumers’ total demand for a commodity constitutes the overall market demand for that commodity. Demand is considered to be negatively related to the price of that commodity: the higher the price, the lower the demand. On the other hand, firms’ supply of the commodity is a positive function of price. The higher the price, the higher the profits for any level of production, hence higher incentive to increase production and supply more quantity.\nLet’s now take an example: suppose that the demand for grain follows a negative linear function.\n\\(Q_{demand} = 7-0.5p\\)\nThat means that the quantity demanded for grains decreases if the price for grain increases and vice and versa. The slope of the demand curve, \\(-0.5\\), means that when the price increases by one, the quantity demanded decreases by 0.5.\nMoreover, let’s say that the quantity supplied for grains is a positive linear function of prices for grain: the higher the price, the more are firms willing to supply grains.\n\\(Q_{supply} = 1+0.6p\\)\n\ndemand &lt;- function(p) 7 - (0.5*p)\nsupply &lt;- function(p) 1 + 0.6*p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the equilibrium price and quantity, we equate the demand and supply functions and solve for q:\n\\[\nq_{demand} = 7- 0.5*p\n\\] \\[\nq_{supply} = 1 + 0.6*p\n\\]\n\\[\nq_{demand} = q_{supply}\n\\]\n\\[\n7 - 0.5*p = 1 + 0.6*p\n\\]\n\\[\n6-0.11p = 0\n\\]\n\\[\np^* = 6/1.1 = 5.45\n\\]\nThe equilibrium price level is thus \\(p^* = 5.45\\). To find the equilibrium quantity, we simple put the value of the equilibrium price (5.45) into either the supply or demand function: \\(7-0.5*5.45 = 4.275 = p^*\\)\nIt is easy to check directly if the computation is correct in r:\n\nequilibrium &lt;- curve_intersect(demand, supply, empirical = FALSE, domain = c(1,10))\nequilibrium\n\n$x\n[1] 5.454545\n\n$y\n[1] 4.272727\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt equilibrium, economists say that “the market clears”. In other words, when equilibrium is reached all commodities are sold, every suppliers have sold their commodities and every consumers have purchased one.\n\n\n1.1.4 Deviations from market price\nIf the price was lower than the market price, for instance after a price control policy (think for example of all the debates about energy price since covid and the war), there would be excess demand. Every commodity would be sold, but there would still be consumers who want to consume the good, but cannot because suppliers do not want to increase production because the price is too low.\nConversely, if the price was above the market price, there would be a situation of excess supply. Firms supply a large quantity of commodities since the price is relatively very high, but not all commodities would be sold because some consumers would think that the price is too high for them.\n\n\n1.1.5 Change in equilibrium prices\nFinally, change in market price happens each time either the supply curve or the demand curve shift to the right (positive shock) or to the left (negative shock).\nRegarding demand curve shifts, (Acemoglu, Laibson, and List 2017, 67) give five factors:\n\nTastes and preferences\nIncome and wealth\nAvailability and prices of related goods\nNumber and scale of buyers\nBuyers’ beliefs about the future\n\nAnd four factors for shifts in supply curve (Acemoglu, Laibson, and List 2017, 73):\n\nPrices of inputs used to produce the good\nTechnology used to produce the good\nNumber and scale of sellers\nSellers’ beliefs about the future\n\nBut how did neoclassical theory arrive to this kind of model of equilibrium price and quantity determination? To understand better this model, we need to know why we have this positive supply curve and this negative demand curve. We will first investigate consumer choice theory, which is behind the negative demand curve, and then production theory, which is behind the positive supply curve.\n\n\n\n\nAcemoglu, Daron, David Laibson, and John A.

    "text": "4.1 Intro\nThe main objective of macroeconomics is to describe and explain the relationship between important economic variables such as unemployment, inflation, production and growth or the interest rate. Questions macroeconomics typically tries to answer are “how can long run growth be sustained?” “how can unemployment be reduced?”. Macroeconomics also takes into account economic policy and the role of the government: how can the government reduce unemployment, increase output and maintain low level of inflation?\nThose are all questions most of macro models try to answer. In this blog post, I will explain one of the most famous and widespread macro model, which is the Investment-Savings - Liquidity-Money model (IS-LM model)."

    "text": "4.2 Production as Gross National Product (GDP)\nThe main feature of the model is a graph, which show the relationship between output and the interest rate. But first, we have to define what is actually output (production) in macro theory.\n\n4.2.1 The three approach to GDP\nProduction is defined as the sum of value added within an economy (can be a nation, a region, or the world taken as a whole) during a period of time (a year, month, semester, quarter…). There are three equivalent ways to define and compute GDP:\n\nProduction approach\nGDP is equal to the value (measured in price) of all final goods and services sold minus the value of all intermediary inputs used in the production process\n\n\\(GDP \\equiv value\\: output\\: sold - cost\\: intermediary\\: inputs\\)\n\nIncome approach\nGDP is equal to the income of all agents in the economy\n\n\\(GDP \\equiv salaries\\:of\\:workers + profits\\:of\\:capital\\:owners\\)\n\nExpenditure approach\nFinally, and this is the most famous definition of GDP, GDP is equal to the total expenditure in the economy, which can be decomposed into the private expenditures of housholds on goods and services C, private expenditure of firms, investment I, and public expenditure G.\n\n\\(GDP \\equiv C + I + G\\)\nIf we take into account the fact that the economy is trading with the rest of the world, we must include the expenditure on imported goods M (imports) and expenditure from the rest of the world for national goods and services X (exports).\n\\(GDP \\equiv C + I + G + (X-I)\\)\nThose three approaches are equivalent. Take for example the income and expenditure methods: it makes sense that any expenditure someone makes has to be a revenue for someone else.\n\n\n4.2.2 Investment-savings curve (IS)\nThe objective of the IS curve is to describe the relationship between the interest rate and output, which is determined by demand in the short run.\nThe first step is to model demand and the equilibrium on the goods and services market. This can be done from the expenditure method to GDP, since expenditure is kind of the same way to say demand.\nThe total demand in a (closed) economy is thus\n\\(Y \\equiv GDP \\equiv C + I + G\\)\n\n4.2.2.1 Consumption C\nBut what determines private consumption C? IS-LM model considers that consumption as a positive function of income \\(Y\\)\n\\(C = C_{0}+C_{1}Y\\)\nWith \\(C_{0}\\) the minimum level of consumption if income is zero, \\(C_{1}\\) the marginal propsentity to consume (the additional consumption resulting from one-unit increase in income Y) and \\(Y\\) the income. Note that income \\(Y\\) is the disposable income, that is, income after tax T: \\(Y_d = Y-T\\). Taxes T can be written as a proportion taken from income \\(T = tY\\) with \\(t\\) the tax rate on income.\nThe consumption function can thus be rewritten:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC = C_{0}+C_{1}Y\n\\\\\nC = C_{0} + C_{1}(Y-tY)\n\\\\\nC = C_{0} + C_{1}Y(1-t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n4.2.2.2 Investment I\nRegarding investment, the latter is considered as a decreasing function of the interest rate i:\n\\(I = I_{0} -iI_{1}\\)\nThe logic behind a negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is the following: the interest rate is the cost of borrowing. The higher the i, the higher it is to finance investment through borrowing. Conversely, at low i borrowing is cheaper, making firms more likely to borrow in order to invest.\n\n\n4.2.2.3 Public spending G\nGovernment spending is considered as exogenous in the is-lm model. This means that G is determined by government decisions which is determined outside the model.\n\n\n4.2.2.4 Final output equation\nThe formula \\(Y \\equiv GDP \\equiv C + I + G\\) can thus take its final IS form:\n\\(Y = [C_{0} + C_{1}Y(1-t)] + [I_{0} - iI_{1}] + \\bar{G}\\)\nWe can see in this equation that ouput Y is negatively related to the interest rate i: the IS curve as thus a negative linear shape.\nTo grasp the function in an easier way, we will just consider that the IS curve is a linear function of consumption (positive relation between output and consumption), Investment and government spending (also positive relation) and the interest rate (negative relation):\n\\(IS = Y = F[C(Y_{+}, T_{-}), I(i_{-}), G_{+}]\\)\n\n#example of a linear IS function\nIS &lt;- function(A, k, x) A - k*x #with A autonomous spending, k the mutliplier and x the interest rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the graph above, an increase in government spending or in consumption (but not due to an increase in income) or in investment (except due to a decline in interest rate) will induce a positive shift (upward) of the IS curve. A negative shock will make a shift downards (negative shock)."

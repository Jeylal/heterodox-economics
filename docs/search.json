    "text": "9.1 Preliminary Notes\n\n9.1.1 Importance and Motivations for Distributional Conflict Models\nNeo-Keynesian and neo-Kaleckian seen in the previous chapters are key models within heterodox macroeconomics. However, all these models consider important variables as exogenous. Neo-Keynesian models typically assume a given nominal wage and the neo-Kaleckian models generally assume an exogenous markup rate (except open-economy models).\nA major drawback of these two types of models is that they do not explicitly give an explanation of inflation arising from distributional conflict. The only exception is the Marglin’s synthesis we saw in the Neo-Keynesian models part.\nDeveloping models which include class conflict between workers and capitalists over the distribution of national income is crucial for heterodox economics, because one characteristic common to all heterodox schools (Marxian, Kalecian, Keynesian…) is that they all recognized that capitalists economies are marked by class conflict.\nWe will see that the outcome of distributive conflict models is the derivation of the distributive curve (DC), which is an important result of post-Keynesian/heterodox macroeconomics. In simple terms, the DC describes the relationship and dynamics between aggregate demand (measure through capacity rate \\(u\\)) and inequality (measured through wage share \\(\\psi\\)). If the DC is positive, higher aggregate demand and growth lead to higher wage share because increase in the former redistributes income to wages (thus a positive DC implies that workers have strong bargaining power). Conversely, a negative DC means that as output and aggregate demand increase, the wage share decreases. We will see that a positive DC is called profit-squeeze and a negative DC wage-squeeze."

    "text": "9.2 Basic Distributional Conflict Model\nA very simple distributional model assumes that capitalists and workers both fight to achieve given objectives. On the one hand, workers want to reach and negotiate a target real wage \\(w_w\\), while they get their actual real wage \\(w\\). On the other hand, firms want to reach a given target markup rate \\(\\tau_f\\), which corresponds to an implicit target real wage for firms \\(w_f\\). But let’s first see how nominal wage changes according to change in target real wage for workers.\n\n9.2.1 Change in Nominal Wage \\(\\hat{W}\\)\nWhen the discrepancy between target real wage and the actual real wage \\(w_w-w\\) is high, workers are willing negotiate higher nominal wage wage to reduce this difference.\nThe degree to which workers will be able to rise their nominal wage depends on many institutional factors such as the strength of labor unions, labor market regulations, unemployment rate and social norms. All these factors will affect the target real wage \\(w_w\\), while the degree to which the discrepancy will pass through higher nominal wage depends on a coefficient, \\(\\phi\\), which can be interpreted as the speed of adjustment of nominal wage:\n\\[\\hat{W}=\\phi(w_w-w)\\]\n\n\n9.2.2 Change in Price \\(\\hat{P}\\)\nOn the price side, change in price will be a positive function of the difference between actual real wage and target real wage for firms \\(w-w_f\\). The higher this difference, the more firms will raise their depending on the price adjustment speed factor \\(\\theta\\), which depends on the monopoly power of the firms and antitrust regulation:\n\\[\\hat{P}=\\theta(w-w_f)\\]\n\n\n9.2.3 Effects of Labor Productivity, Target Wage Share instead of Real Wage\nHowever, this simple model omits important factors such as labor productivity. An increase in labor productivity \\(Q = 1/a_0\\) decreases the wage share \\(\\psi=\\frac{W}{P}a_0\\). Hence, when labor productivity rises, workers may want to negotiate higher nominal wage so that the wage share is held constant. On the firms side, increase in labor productivity allow them to reduce price increase, because labor productivity gains reduce (unit labor) costs.\nMoreover, workers and firms may rather target a given wage share and profit share instead of real wage (and markup rate).\nIncluding labor productivity changes the simple model as such:\n\\[\\hat{W} = \\phi(\\psi_w-\\psi)+\\beta{q} + \\alpha{\\hat{P}}\\] Note that I also include here \\(\\alpha{\\hat{P}}\\), which reflects to what degree nominal wage are indexed to inflation (no inflation would be the \\(\\alpha=0\\) case, perfect indexation, \\(\\alpha=1\\)).\n\\[\\hat{P}=\\theta(\\psi-\\psi_f)-\\gamma{q}\\]\nWith \\(q=Y/L=1/a_0\\) labor productivity, \\(\\psi_{w}\\) the target wage share of workers and \\(\\psi_f\\) the target wage share for firms."

    "text": "9.3 The Distributive Curve (DC)\nSome further steps are required to derive the distributive curve from the model above.\n\n9.3.1 Modeling Target Wage Share for Firms and Workers as Functions of \\(u\\)\nThe next step is to model changes in target wage share for firms and workers.\nA rise in the capacity rate of utilization \\(u=Y/Y_k\\) can be considered as synonymous of increasing employment rate. Moreover, as employment rate increases, workers are assumed to be more able to negotiate higher wage share, mainly because lower unemployment implies stronger bargaining power for workers. Hence, the model assumes that \\(\\psi_w\\) is a positive function of utilization rate \\(u\\):\n\\[\\psi_w=\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1{u}\\]\nIn addition, the target profit share \\(1-\\psi_f\\) can also be written as a funtion of capacity rate:\n\\[1-\\psi_f=\\eta_0+\\eta_1u\\]\nNote that \\(\\eta_1\\) can be either positive or negative. On the one hand, firms could target higher markup rate, hence profit share, because they would try to raise profits when sales are reduced during a recession. On the other hand, during expansion (rise in \\(u\\)), firms could have the possibility to raise prices without losing customers.\nNow that target wage share for firms and workers are modeled as functions of \\(u\\), they can be substituted in the nominal wage and price change equations. Thus,\n\\[\\hat{W} = \\phi(\\psi_w-\\psi)+\\beta{q} + \\alpha{\\hat{P}}\\] \\[\\hat{P}=\\theta(\\psi-\\psi_f)-\\gamma{q}\\] become\n\\[\\hat{W} = \\phi(\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1{u}-\\psi)+\\beta{q} + \\alpha{\\hat{P}}\\] \\[\\hat{P}=\\theta(\\psi-1+\\eta_0+\\eta_1u))-\\gamma{q}\\]\n\n\n9.3.2 Modeling productivity as a Function of \\(u, \\psi, y\\)\nThe final step to complete the model and derive the DC curve is to model labor productivity growth \\(q = \\hat{Y}-\\hat{L}\\) as function of capacity rate \\(u=Y/Y_k\\).\nHowever, \\(q\\) also depends on other variables such as the wage share or output growth, here is a summary of the variables affecting labor productivity growth:\n\nCapacity utilization \\(u\\) (+):\nIn the short run, labor productivity growth is positively associated with output and utilization because of overhead labor. Overhead labor refers to managers, engineers and all the workers who are not easily fired during a recession. Thus, in a short run recession (when output and \\(u\\) fall), \\(L\\) does not fall enough and thus \\(Y\\) falls more than \\(L\\), making the labor productivity ratio fall \\(Q = \\frac{Y}{L}\\). Conversely, during short run expansion (rise of output and utilization), labor productivity increases because hiring is less than proportional to output increase (\\(Y\\) increase more than \\(L\\)).\nWage Share \\(\\psi\\) (+):\nA higher wage share can induce firms to invest more in labor-saving equipment. The reason is that by investing in labor-saving equipment, firms can decrease workers’ bargaining power. Hence, when labor costs are high, labor productivity is expected to rise.\nOutput Growth \\(y\\) (+)\nVerdoorn and Kaldor showed that growth of output and labor productivity are positively associated and even positively influence each other. Labor productivity growth increases output growth, because more \\(Y\\) is produced for the same quantity of labor, but this rise in output growth will in return also have a positive impact on \\(q\\).\n\nTo sum up, labor productivity growth can be written as a linear function of \\(u\\) and \\(\\psi\\):\n\\[q=q_0+q_1u+q_2\\psi\\]\n\n\n9.3.3 Equilibrium and Distributional Conflict curve\nWe have thus the following wage and price inflation functions:\n\\[\\hat{W} = \\phi(\\lambda_0+\\lambda_1{u}-\\psi)+\\beta{(q_0+q_1u+q_2\\psi)} + \\alpha{\\hat{P}}\\]\n\\[\\hat{P}=\\theta(\\psi-1+\\eta_0+\\eta_1u))-\\gamma{(q_0+q_1u+q_2\\psi)}\\]\nTo derive the DC, we equate \\(\\hat{P}=\\hat{W}\\) and solve for the equilibrium wage share \\(\\psi\\), which gives:\n\\[\\psi=\\frac{\\phi\\lambda_0+\\theta(1-\\alpha)(1-\\eta_0)-q_0+u[\\phi\\lambda_1-\\theta\\eta_1(1-\\alpha)-q_1]}{\\phi+\\theta(1-\\alpha)+q_2}\\]\nThis equation seems complicated, with a lot of different variables. However, it is only the sign of\n\\[u[\\phi\\lambda_1-\\theta\\eta_1(1-\\alpha)-q_1]\\]\nwhich truly is of interest here, because it will determine whether the utilization \\(u\\) will have a positive impact of the wage share or not.\nRemember that:\n\n\\(\\phi\\) is the speed of adjustment of nominal wages when workers bargain for higher wage share.\n\\(\\lambda_1\\) is the positive marginal impact of \\(u\\) on target wage share \\(\\psi_w\\) for workers.\n\nHence, the product \\(\\phi\\lambda_1\\) can be interpreted as a set of institutional factors which reinforce workers’ bargaining power. \\(\\phi\\lambda_1\\) reflects the bargaining power of workers.\n\n\nBut this product is subtracted by:\n\n\\(\\theta\\eta_1\\), which is the degree to which firms raise price during a short term recession (\\(\\eta_1\\)) multiplied by the speed of adjustment of price to target wage share for firms. This product is also multiplied by the inverse of the degree of indexation (of nominal wage to inflation). The higher are nominal wages indexed to inflation, the more likely the final sign of the bracket will be positive.\n\nHence, \\(\\theta\\eta_1\\) reflects the monopoly power of firms\n\n\\(q_1\\), which is the marginal impact of utilization on labor productivity growth. The higher is \\(q_1\\), the more a rise in utilization makes labor productivity increase and since the latter has a negative impact of the wage share, the higher is \\(q_1\\), the more likely a rise in \\(u\\) will have a negative impact on the wage share.\n\nTo sum up, the DC can be either positive or negative depending on the final sign of the bracket above. The more is the institutional framework favorable to workers (wage indexation, strength of labor union, labor market legislation…), the more likely is the DC to be positive (and conversely).\n\n\n\nThe different types of DC, Blecker and Setterfield (2019, 222)\n\n\nAs explained in the introduction, there are two types of DC (we ignore the third type shown in the illustration above):\n\nProfit-squeeze DC:\nWhen the impact of higher utilization and employment of wage increase is superior than the effect on price and productivity growth, an increase in utilization will increase the wage share. This positive relationship between wage share and utilization is called “profit-squeeze” because an increase in output and \\(u\\) make redistribute income to wages and thus decreases the profit share.\nWage-squeeze DC:\nWhen the impact of higher utilization, output and employment on productivity growth and price increase is superior to the rise in wages, the DC is called “wage-squeeze” because there is a negative relationship (impact) of output and utilization on the wage share. The more output and utilization increase, the more is total income more favorably redistributed to profits and thus the wage share decline and the profit share increase."

    "text": "9.4 Combining Distributional Curve and Demand Regimes\nIn the last chapter on neo-Kaleckian model, we saw that the demand regime (how utilization and output are related to the wage share and profit share) could be either:\n\nProfit-led\nWhen an increase in the wage share has a negative impact on utilization and output, because aggregate demand is driven mainly by investment and/or exports.\nWage-led\nWhen an increase in the wage share has a positive impact on utilization and output, because aggregate demand is mainly driven by private domestic consumption.\n\nWe now saw that an economy is not only characterized by either wage-led or profit-led demand, but that is has also either a wage-squeeze or profit-squeeze DC. There are thus many combinations possible: an economy can have a profit-led demand with a wage-squeeze DC, a wage-led demand and a wage-squeeze DC and so on.\nHowever, how these combinations can be interpreted depends on some assumptions. There are two possible assumptions:\n\nDemand and output (utilization) adjust more rapidly than distribution (nominal wages and prices).\nDemand and output, and prices, wages and distribution have the same adjustment speed.\n\n\n9.4.1 1. Demand adjusts more rapidly\nIn that case, the economy is always on the AD curve in the short run and the DC curve only puts pressure on the wage share and utilization at the medium and long run. At any point below the DC curve, there is an upward pressure on the wage share and a downwards pressure at any point above it.\n\n\n\nBlecker and Setterfield (2019, 227)\n\n\nThe illustration above shows the possible scenarios in the case of a wage-led demand regime (upward slopping AD curve).\nBut what does it actually mean to have, for instance, a wage-led demand regime with a wage-squeeze distributive curve (graph a)? Wage-led demand regime means that, as the wage share increase, utilization and output rise as well. But since distribution is wage-squeeze, as output and utilization increase distributional dynamics which are unfavorable to workers and their wage share will decrease the wage share and increase the profit share. Therefore, at low level of utilization (any point on the left on the graph, at low \\(u\\)), the wage share is also relatively low. Subsequently, output, utilization and the wage share will gradually increase (because either increase in wage share or utilization will have a positive feedback) on each other until the AD curve crosses the DC curve.\nIf the DC and demand curves are positive, we have both wage-led demand and profit-squeeze distribution. If the DC curve has a slower slope than AD curve, we are in scenario (b), if it is higher, it corresponds to scenario (c). Having wage-led demand and profit-squeeze distribution means that higher wage share will have a positive impact on utilization which, in return, will redistribute even more of total income to the wage share, which in return will increase utilization even further and so on. The difference between scenario b and c is that in c the slope of the DC curve is higher, meaning that the effect of \\(u\\) on distribution is very favorable to workers and their wage share. In that case, it is possible that the positive interaction between increasing \\(u\\) and the wage share never stops (this is why there are arrows pointing away from equilibrium in graph c)."

    "text": "8.1 Summary of Kalecki-Steindl model\nWa saw in the previous chapter that the Kalecki-Steindl has strong implications for growth. A decrease in markup and profit share leads to higher growth, real wage and profit rates. Such an economy is known in the literature as wage-led economy.\nHowever, these rather unusual results, compared with all the models seen until now, are the results of the assumptions of the model, which are:\n\nFlexible capacity rate of utilization\nMarkup pricing\nSpecification of the investment function: \\(g = g_0 + g_r + g_2u\\)\nNo Government (no taxes, no government spending)\nClosed economy (no foreign trade)\nNo savings out of wages (all savings come out of profits)\n\nIn this chapter, we will see that some economists came out with different conclusions by relaxing some of the assumptions above. In fact, it will be shown that, by relaxing assumptions 6 and by considering another specification of the investment function, an economy can not only be wage-led, but also profit-led (when demand resulting from investment drives economic growth). A further complexification of the model is to relax assumption 5 and include foreign trade in the model.\n\n8.1.1 Savings out of Wages\n\n8.1.1.1 Similarities with the Early Kaldorian Model\nAssuming, as the Kalecki-Steindl model does, that there is no positive savings out of wages is not a realistic assumptions. In effect, savings out of wages can be very low and most of the time lower than savings out of profits, but they still exist. It it thus important to consider how positive savings out of wages can be included in the model, and see how the model changes. It is also important to take savings out of wages into account, because the latter varies a lot accross countries: there are countries in which savings out of wages are relatively higher than other countries (East Asia for instance). Hence, relaxing this assumption is of great interest. But how is it done?\nRemember that we already a model which includes positive savings out of wages: the early Kaldorian model (EKM). (Blecker and Setterfield 2019, 182) introduces the following saving function, which is very similar to the EKM saving function:\n\\[\\sigma = S/K = [s_r\\pi+s_w(1-\\pi)]\\frac{u}{a_1}\\]\nNote that we assume positive savings out of wages, but with a lower propensity than savings out of profits: \\(0&lt;s_w&lt;s_r&lt;1\\). The rational behind this is that wages recipients have a higher propensity to consumer that profits recipients since the latter have a relatively higher income.\nNote that the only difference with the EKM savings function is the fact that \\(u\\) appears in this alternative Neo-Kaleckian model, whereas is was assumed constant at full capacity in the EKM.\nIt is important to keep in mind that \\(s_r\\) and \\(s_w\\) are the saving propensities out of the types of income received (here profits and wages), they do not refer to saving propensities of workers and capitalists. A worker can receive both wage and profits revenues, and we assume here that workers will save income out of profits more than income out of wages. That means that profits are always saved at a higher propensity than wages.\n\n\n8.1.1.2 Effects on the model\nThe main effects of including positive savings out of wages are the following:\n\nThe main variables of the model (capacity, profits, investment rates) are now not necessarily inversely related with the profit share. It can be thus possible that the economy is not wage-led.\nWhether an economy is wage-led or profit-led depends on the gap between the saving propensity out of profits and wages \\((s_r-s_w)\\). The higher the gap (the higher \\(s_r\\) is relatively to \\(s_w\\)), the more likely is the economy (through demand) to be wage-led, because the gains from increasing consumer demand after redistribution of income towards wages will be large. Remember that when \\(s_w =0\\), the economy would always be wage-led.\nIf the gap between \\(s_r, s_w\\) is small (when \\(s_r\\) is closed to \\(s_w\\)), demand is more likely to be profit-led. The logic behind this is that the loss of investment demand after a redistribution of income unfavorable to profits and favorable to wages will outweigh the gain in consumption demand, because the propensity to consume out of wages is relatively low.\nThe higher the responsiveness of investment to profits (\\(g_1\\)), the more likely are demand and growth to be profit-led. That means that higher profit share would boost investment so much that the negative effects of reduced consumption out of wages would be surpassed and outweighed.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Modifying the Investment function\n\n8.1.2.1 Flaws of the Kalecki-Steindl Investment function\nIn the previous chapter, the Kalecki-Steindl investment function was:\n\\[g=g_0+g_1r+g_2u\\]\nThis specification (was of defining) the investment function as positively related to profit rate of utilization rate was criticized by Marglin and Bhaduri (1991), who argued that the utilization rate is double counted in this specification, imposing an overstated role of demand on investment in the economy. \\(u\\) is double counted because profit rate can be written as \\(r = \\pi u/a_1\\):\n\\[g=g_0+g_1\\frac{\\pi u}{a_1}+g_2u\\]\nBut the double counting of \\(u\\) is not the only problem. In fact, assuming that \\(g_2\\) is always positive (meaning that increase in capacity rate will have a positive effect of investment) is also unrealistic, because it implies that when utilization increases and profit share falls simultaneously, firms will always want to invest more1. Marglin and Bhaduri (1991) argued that this was not a reasonable assumption and that \\(g_2\\) could be either positive or negative.\n\n\n8.1.2.2 Marglin-Badhuri Investment Function\nMarglin and Bhaduri (1991) thus proposed a new investment function combining Kaleckian and Robinsonian elements:\n\\[g = f[r^e(\\pi,u)] = h(\\pi,u)\\] This modified investment function means that investment depends positively on the capacity rate \\(u\\) and profit share \\(\\pi\\). This specification assumes that the partial derivatives \\(h_\\pi\\) and \\(h_u\\) are positive. That means that if \\(u\\) stays constant and \\(\\pi\\) increase (or conversely), firms will be willing to invest more. \\(h_\\pi\\) is interpreted as the profitability effect of investment (the marginal effect of profit share on investment, with \\(u\\) fixed).\nUsing this new investment function, an economy can be profit-led even if we assume that there is not positive savings out of wages \\(s_w=0\\) and no international trade."

    "section": "8.2 Summary",
    "text": "8.2 Summary\nTo sum up, here’s first an explanation of what is meant by “wage-led” and “profit-led” demand:\n\nWage-led demand means that aggregate demand \\(Y = C+I\\) (recall that we assume no government and foreign trade, so aggregate demand ignores \\(G\\) and \\(X-M\\)) is driven by private consumption \\(C\\). In other words, when the wage share increases (and profit share decreases), aggregate demand increases through \\(C\\) and this effect surpasses the fall of investment \\(I\\) due to lower profitability. The logic behind wage-led demand is to consider that a redistribution of income towards wages boost private consumption so much that growth, investment, real wage and profit rates increase. Thus, a rise in the wage share boosts the economy through positive effect on demand.\nProfit-led demand means that a rise in the profit share boosts investment so much that this effect offsets and even surpasses the fall in private consumption due to a fall in the wage share. Firms are very responsive to the increase in their profit share and are thus willing to invest a lot."

    "section": "8.3 Open Economy Neo-Kaleckian Model",
    "text": "8.3 Open Economy Neo-Kaleckian Model\nHow would the neo-Kaleckian model change is the assumption of no foreign trade is relaxed? So that aggregate demand now includes \\(X-M\\), the external balance (exports minus imports) in \\(Y = C+I+(X-M)\\).\nTaking foreign trade into account changes how labor costs, or rising real wage/wage share can affect aggregate demand and output. A rise in unit labor costs \\(Wa_0=WL/Y\\) in an economy (“home economy”) can potentially lead to a rise in the price of exported goods, for instance if unit labor cost rise in a firm which exports a lot of goods. This rise in the price of exports implies a loss of competitiveness: demand for the exported goods can decrease in the price increase too much relatively with other exporting countries. Home products thus loose competitiveness, and this can have an negative impact on aggregate demand which surpasses the positive impact due to the rise of consumer demand (due to rise in wages). A redistribution of income favorable to wages can, even if the domestic economy is wage-led, lead to a contraction of aggregate demand and output.\n\n8.3.1 New Markup Pricing Equation\nRelaxing the assumption of no foreign trade also affects how markup pricing is defined. Remember from last chapter that the markup pricing equation was:\n\\[P = (1+\\tau)Wa_0\\]\nThis equation can be rewritten to write markup rate \\(1+\\tau\\) as a function of price and unit labor cost:\n\\[1+\\tau=\\frac{P}{Wa_0}\\]\n(Blecker and Setterfield 2019, 190) then rewrite the right part of this equation as follows:\n\\[1+\\tau=\\mu\\left(\\frac{EP_f}{P}\\right)^\\eta\\]\nWith \\(\\mu&gt;1\\) the target or desired markup rate of firms, \\(P_f\\) the foreign price level, \\(P\\) home price level, \\(E\\) nominal exchange rate and \\(\\eta\\) the elasticity of the price–cost margin with respect to the real exchange rate.\nThis equation basically tells that when real exchange rate rises \\(\\nearrow \\left(\\frac{EP_f}{P}\\right)\\), meaning that home goods and services become relatively cheaper (foreign goods become more expensive, there is a real depreciation of home currency, foreign currencies become more expensive), firms will respond by raising their markup to take advantage of increasing competitiveness (make more revenues for each sale).\nConversely, if home products become relatively more expensive (the real exchange rate appreciate, \\(\\searrow \\left(\\frac{EP_f}{P}\\right)\\)), firms will decrease their markup to try to keep competitiveness (keep selling goods).\nBy replacing \\(P\\) in the denominator of the equation above by \\((1+\\tau)Wa_0\\), leads to:\n\\[1+\\tau=\\mu^{\\frac{1}{1+\\eta}}\\left(\\frac{EP_f}{Wa_0}\\right)^{\\frac{\\eta}{1+\\eta}}\\]\n\\(\\frac{EP_f}{Wa_0}\\) is the ratio of foreign price to domestic unit labor cost (how much labor costs for each unit of output). This ratio is a measure of firms’ international competitiveness in terms of unit labor costs. Thus, international trade changes the model by showing a negative impact of unit labor costs on markup \\(\\tau\\).\n\n\n8.3.2 New Profit Share Equation\nThe factors affecting profit share \\(\\pi\\) will also change. When there is no international trade, profit share was a positive function of markup \\(\\tau\\) only:\n\\[\\pi=\\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}\\] Once international trade is included, profit share is not only a positive function of (target) markup, but also of the ratio \\(\\frac{EP_f}{Wa_0}\\) written as \\(z\\) below:\n\\[\\pi=\\pi(\\mu_+,z_+)\\] With \\(\\pi_\\mu&gt;0\\) and \\(\\pi_z&gt;0\\) (both partial derivatives are positive, meaning that both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(z\\) have positive impact). Conversely, the wage share \\(\\psi=1-\\pi\\) is negatively related with these two factors.\n\n\n8.3.3 Modelling the Trade Balance\nThe next step is to model net exports \\((X-M)\\). The trade balance is considered a positive function of the real exchange rate \\(\\frac{EP_f}{P}\\) and negatively related to the ratio of capacity utilization on the capital-output ratio \\(\\frac{u}{a_1}\\):\n\\[b=b\\left(\\frac{EP_f}{P}_{(+)}, \\frac{u}{a_1}_{(-)}\\right)\\]\nNet exports are positively related with the real exchange rate, because an increase of the latter is synonym of real depreciation and, assuming that the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied2, real depreciation ameliorates the trade balance by increasing exports.\nTrade balance \\(b\\) in inversely related to \\(u/a_1\\) because the increase in the latter is associated with rising demand for imports relative to capital.\n\n\n8.3.4 New Investment Function\nRegarding the investment function, the latter becomes:\n\\[g=h_0+h_1(\\pi-\\pi_f)+h_2\\frac{u}{a_1}\\]\nWith \\(h_1,h_2&gt;0\\). What changes is that investment now depends positively on the difference between the domestic profit share and the foreign profit share \\((\\pi-\\pi_f)\\). The reason is that once we consider competition with foreign countries, the profit share of the domestic country must be greater than profit share in foreign countries. Otherwise, capital would simply move abroad (firms would not invest in the home economy if profits are higher in other parts of the world). \\((\\pi-\\pi_f)\\) can be interpreted as a difference in profitability between the domestic economy and the rest of the world.\n\n\n8.3.5 New Equilibrium Condition\nNow that we are considering trade balance, domestic savings \\(\\sigma\\) are not only equal to domestic investment \\(g\\), but also equal to the trade balance \\(b\\):\n\\[\\sigma=g+b\\]\nThe variables above could be replaced by their respective definitions, but since it would be tedious, I will simply conclude by summarizing the intuitions of how the main variables of interest interact between them.\n\n\n8.3.6 Impacts of variations in \\(z\\) and \\(\\mu\\)\nSince the two exogenous variables of this model are the target markup for firms \\(\\mu\\) and the international competitiveness to labor costs ratio \\(z = \\frac{EP_f}{Wa_0}\\), we have to see how their variation impact the other variables of the model to see what are the main results and conclusions of the model.\n\n8.3.6.1 Increase in markup \\(\\mu\\)\nAn increase in target markup for firms (for instance after reduced competition) increases (domestic) profit share, but decreases international competitiveness since an increase in target markups increases domestic prices.\nA rise in markup \\(\\mu\\) makes home products more expensive and thus reduces net exports while at the same time increasing the profit share \\(\\pi\\) and reducing the equilibrium rate of capacity, making the economy more likely to be wage-led.\n\\(\\nearrow{\\mu} \\Rightarrow \\searrow{b} \\Rightarrow \\searrow{u}, \\nearrow \\pi\\)\n\n\n8.3.6.2 Increase in international competitiveness \\(z\\) (decrease in wage share)\nAn increase in \\(z\\) (for instance after a fall in labor costs after a cut in nominal wages) also increases profit share and has a positive impact on international competitiveness.\nFurthermore, an increase in \\(z\\), makes home products relatively cheaper, increases net exports and increases profit share \\(\\pi\\), thus having a positive impact on \\(u\\) and making profit-led demand more likely to obtain.\n\\(\\searrow{W} \\Rightarrow \\nearrow{z} \\Rightarrow \\nearrow{b} \\Rightarrow \\nearrow{u}, \\nearrow \\pi\\)\nThe main conclusion of the open-economy model is that an economy cannot be classified directly as having wage-led or profit-led demand, because it is the source of the exogenous shocks (changes in either \\(z\\) and \\(\\mu\\)) on income distribution that will provoke wage-led or profit-led effects.\nTo sum up:\n\nChanges in the industrial structure affecting \\(\\mu\\) (concentration and all the factors affecting markup explained in the previous chapter) will in general have wage-led effects.\nChanges in international competitiveness relative to labor costs, \\(z\\), will in general have profit-led effects\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that these effects of international trade can still be offset and surpassed by domestic impact of distributional shifts. If the domestic demand is strongly wage-led, an increase in the wage share will still lead to higher growth and capacity rate even if exports decline (assuming that international competitive effects are relatively weak). This would be the case, for instance, of any country which is rather closed to foreign trade or has relatively low level of foreign trade with other countries.\nSimilarly, if any given economy is strongly profit-led, then a rise in markup \\(\\mu\\) can still have a positive impact of utilization rate and growth even though there are losses on the international trade side.\n\n\n\n8.3.7 Open Economy neo-Kaleckian Model and Currency Depreciation\nThis neo-Kaleckian open economy model also has strong implication for foreign trade policy (currency depreciation).\nA depreciation makes \\(z\\) rise. If the domestic economy shows profit-led response to such a shock (meaning that exports increase a lot and outweigh the loss in consumption demand from decreased purchasing power of households), the depreciation is expansionary.\nOn the other hand, if the economy shows a wage-led response, the depreciation will not be expansionary. The reason is that depreciation reduces domestic purchasing power of households and if domestic demand is strongly wage-led, depreciation will not rise exports enough to compensate the loss in domestic consumer demand and will have negative effects on growth.\nFinally, a depreciation, rise in \\(z\\), will always rise profit share and thus make the distribution of income more unequal. In addition, if the economy has wage-led demand, the depreciation is likely to be contractionary.\n\n\n\n\nBlecker, Robert A., and Mark Setterfield. 2019.

    "text": "7.1 Preliminary Notes\n\n7.1.1 Biographical notes, authors and sources\nMichał Kalecki (1899-1970) was a Polish economist and major figure of heterodox and Post-Keynesian economics. He made important contributions in macroeconomics and political economy, and his work represents a crucial legacy for a lot of contemporary work in heterodox economics.\nThe models that will be presented here are related to the macroeconomics of Kalecki. Kalecki (1954) is often considered as the work which laid out the foundations of Kalecki’s macroeconomics that will be exposed here.\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that Kalecki also developed a theory of political business cycles (I talk shortly about this theory here) Kalecki (1943). What will be presented here (based on the manual Blecker and Setterfield (2019)) will be hence just a part of the (many) important contributions of Kalecki in political economy and macroeconomics.\nThe Neo-Kaleckian model is actually posterior to Kalecki (hence “Neo”), but heavily based on his work. It was developed by Kaleckian economists in the 70s and 80s based on Kalecki’s work, but also on the work of Josef Steindl (1912-1993), an Austrian Post-Keynesian economist who was a close collegue of Kalecki. The first Neo-Kaleckian model that will be presented here is called by Blecker and Setterfield (2019) the “Kaleckian-Steindl” model and is based on Post-Keynesian writings in the 70s and 80s, for instance Harris (1974) (Donald J. Harris who is by the way the father of Kemala Harris, current vice-president of the United-States) and Asimakopulos (1975).\nUntil now, almost all the heterodox models summarized until now, the Classical-Marxian models (CMMs) and the Neo-Keynesian models (NKMs), explain that more rapid growth can only be achieve at the expense of a more unequal distribution of income. In other words, the CMMs and NKMs explain that increasing the rate of growth implies more inequality through either lower real wage or lower wage share.\nOne major flaw of the CMMs and NKMs is that they either don’t incorporate the important role of aggregate demand in the analysis (in the case of the CMMs) or only partially incorporate it (for the NKMs). Why is it important to take aggregate demand into account when one wants to analyze the determinants of economic growth? Before answering this question, let’s first remind ourserlves what aggregate demand is. The latter can be defined as the sum of all demand sources for goods and services in an economy.\n\n\n7.1.2 Aggregate Demand\nAggregate demand is often summarized with the following accounting identity:\n\\[Y^d \\equiv C+I+G+(X-M)\\]\nWith \\(Y^d\\) aggregate demand, which depends positively:\n\n\\(C\\), private consumption demand (by individuals, not firms nor the government, nor foreigners). \\(C\\) is the sum of all private consumption in a given economy.\n\\(I\\), investment demand. The latter represents all purchases of capital goods by firms and all new residential investment. It includes mainly the purchase by firms of machinery, tools, raw materials and other equipment. However, residential investment (purchase of new houses) is also considered as an investment in national accounts.\n\\(G\\), the demand coming from government purchases of goods and services.\n\\(X\\), the demand coming from purchase by foreigners of national goods and services. It represents all exportation made by the economy. Subtracted by \\(M\\), which is imported goods and services, we get the trade balance.\n\nWhy is aggregate demand important? Because any increase in demand gives impetus to economic expansion: the higher the demand for goods and services, the more firms will want to respond by producing more. Demand does not mechanically accommodate to supply, as it is assumed in CMMs and NKMs. The idea that demand can never be a constraint to production is know as Say’s Law: demand will always accommodate supply because supply creates demand by itself. For instance, if I produce coffee beans, I will either consume it or want to trade it for other goods or services: my production has thus create at the same time my demand. It may sound paradoxical to say that CMMs and NKMs implicitly accepted Say’s Law or at least did not put it into question since Marx, Keynes and Post-Neo-Keynesian economists are famous for their critic of Say’s law.\nNonetheless, the Neo-Kaleckian models presented below are the firsts to really put Say’s Law into question and put aggregrate demand at the center. The (neo)-kaleckian models are thus very important among heterdox models of economic growth, because it the former incorporates the role of aggregate demand and its impact on growth, even in the long run."

    "section": "7.2 Main characteristics of the model",
    "text": "7.2 Main characteristics of the model\n\n7.2.1 Capacity rate of utilization\nThe main difference of the Neo-Kaleckian model with the CMMs and NKMs is that the Neo-Kaleckian model does not make the assumption that the capacity rate of utilization is fixed, constant, or constant at full level \\(u = 1\\). But what is the rate of capacity utilization already?\nThe rate of capacity utilization \\(u\\) is the ratio of actual output \\(Y\\) to the full-capacity output \\(Y_k\\), which is the output level when all capital is used in the economy. The capacity rate can be thus written as\n\\[u = \\frac{Y}{Y_k}\\] If we consider, as the CMMs and NKMs, that \\(u = 1\\), we simply say that \\(Y = Y_k\\). In other words, \\(u = 1\\) means that all capital is used in the production process in the economy. If, for instance, \\(u = 0.5\\), that means that actual output is only half of what it could be if all capital was used in production.\nA major characteristics of the Neo-Kaleckian model is that the model considers that the capacity rate \\(u\\) is flexible and not equal to one: the level of output is thus never at its full capacity level, contrary to the previous models presented in the manual.\n\n7.2.1.1 3 Reasons why u&lt;1\nWhy does the Neo-Kaleckian model has such a conception of the capacity rate? There are three main reasons for which firms do not operate at full capacity (full utilization of capital).\n\nIndivisibilities\nFirms tend to purchase capital goods (machinery, raw materials, tools…) which can be obtained only in large and discontinuous units, and thus can be operated at less than 100 per cent of their potential.\nBuilding ahead of demand\nSince firms do not know and cannot know what the demand for their products will be in the future (fundamental uncertainty of the future), they will hold excess capacity (excess capital not used in production) in case if demand rise in the future. If firms did not hold excess capacity and if demand suddenly happened to rise, they would not be able to respond by increasing production.\nEntry deterrence\nMost large firms operate in a non-competitive (great number of competitive firms) framework, in which only a few large oligopolistic firms compete in the market. In this situation, these large firms will hold excess capacity as a weapon in case if new firms (new entrants) would want to enter the market as producers and compete with the established firms. Having excess capacity allows established firms to be able to rise production immediately and thus push price downwards to crush any potential new competitors.\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Prices as markups over costs\nIn most models described until now, none of them had a precise model/equation describing how prices are set by firms. The Neo-Kaleckian has an explicit and precise definition of how prices are set. Recall that in the context of perfect competition, standard economic theory tells that prices are the result of the equilibrium between demand and supply. In the Neo-Kaleckian framework, markets are not perfectly competitive and firms have what economics call “market power”, that is, the power to influence prices and thus set the latter.\nHow will firms then set prices in the Neo-Kaleckian model? The manual presents the following price equation:\n\\[P = (1 + \\tau)Wa_0\\]\nWhich means that a firm will increase price \\(P\\) if it decides to rise its markup rate \\(\\tau\\), or if nominal wage increase \\(W\\) (since nominal wage is a cost for the firm, note that here other costs are ignored for simplicity and only labor costs are taken into account), or if \\(a_0 = \\frac{L}{Y}\\), the labor/output ratio increases. Here, \\(Y\\) refers to the output produced by the firm and \\(L\\) the amount of labor employed by the firm. The idea that prices are not determined by demand and supply equilibrium, but by markup over costs is called markup pricing.\nOnce the markup pricing equation is defined, it can be shown that the profit share \\(\\pi\\) is a positive (monotonic) function of markup \\(\\tau\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\pi = \\frac{P - Wa_0}{P}\n\\\\\n= \\frac{(1+\\tau)Wa_0-Wa_0}{(1+\\tau)Wa_0}\n\\\\\n\\pi = \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\\pi = \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}\\] The higher the markup \\(\\tau\\), the higher the profit share.\nWhat will influence change in the markup rate \\(\\tau\\), and thus increase profit share and inequality? Kalecki and the manual give five main factors which will influence the markup (a + or - sign is added next to each factor to indicate whether it rises the markup or decreases it):\n\nIndustrial concentration (+)\nThe fewer the firms are in competition with each other, the less the market is competitive and the more firms have market power to increase prices through an increase in their markup.\n‘Overheads’ or fixed costs (+)\nBy these overhead and fixed costs, we mean all the costs associated with machinery and equipment, management, maintenance (overhead labor), Research & Development expenses, intellectual property rights costs or debt service expenses. All these costs are taken into account by firms, which want to set price with a markup over these costs. If these costs increase, firms will also want to increase the markup to set a prices bringing enough revenues.\nSales effort (+)\nWhen firms operate under an oligopolistic framework (few firms, low competition between firms), adverstising is important to increase the number of consumers. Moreover, adverstising is also useful for ’product differentiation”, that is, convincing consumers that the firm’s products are different than the other products offered in the market. Consumers would then be more disposed to consume the differentiated product at a higher price. Advertising is thus both a way to increase the number of consumers and a way to increase oligopolistic market power.\nStrength of labour unions (-)\nIf workers within a firm have enough bargaining power, they may are able to capture parts of the firms’s potential profits. The degree of power workers can have depend on the existence and strength of labor unions: the more labor unions there are and the stronger and more well-organized and powerful they are, they more firms will have to share their value added, and thus decrease their markups.\nExternal competition (-)\nThe more national firms are in competition with the rest of the world, the more competitive pressure they have to lower their price, and thus their markup.\n\n\n\n7.2.3 New wage-profit relationship\nAs with the CMMs, we start with the definition of national income under the income approach: national income is the sum of capitalists and workers’ income (profits and wages, ignoring depreciation, no government, only one good):\n\\[PY = WL + rPK\\] Dividing by \\(PY\\), we get a new inverse wage profit relationship:\n\\[w = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0} \\frac{r}{u}\\]\nThis equation is almost the same as the one we derived in the classical-marxian models. Since the CMMs assumed a full and constant capacity rate of utilization \\(u = 1\\), it does not appear in their wage-profit equation. However, \\(u\\) appears here in the denominator of the \\(r/u\\) fraction because it is assumed to be inferior to one (below full capacity) and flexible. In the equation above, wage appears to be a positive function of \\(u\\), but this is misleading since \\(u\\) and profit rate \\(r\\) are not independent of each other, meaning that if one of the two variables increases, the other will change as well, leaving an ambiguous impact on real wage \\(w\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows the inverse wage-profit relationship when the capacity rate is equal to one (u = 1), as in the CMMs, and when it is inferior to one, as in the Neo-Kaleckian models. A rise in u allows for both the profit rate and the real wage to rise.\nRecall that real wage \\(w\\) is \\(W/P\\). By replacing \\(P\\) by the price equation we saw above (\\(P = (1 + \\tau)Wa_0\\)), we can see how the real wage is related to income distribution and inequality:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nw = \\frac{W}{P} = \\frac{W}{(1+\\tau)Wa_0} = (\\frac{1}{1+\\tau})\\frac{1}{a_0}\n\\\\\nw = \\frac{1 - \\pi}{a_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo sum up, we have\n\nReal wage as a positive function of wage share \\(\\psi = 1-\\pi\\), labor productivity \\(1/a_0\\), utilization rate \\(u = Y/Y_K\\) and negative with profit rate \\(r\\)\n\n\\(w = \\frac{1 - \\pi}{a_0}\\)\n\\(w = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0} \\frac{r}{u}\\)\n\nProfit rate as a positive function of profit share \\(\\pi\\), utilization rate \\(u\\), and capital productivity \\(1/a_1\\); and profit share \\(\\pi\\) as a positive function of markup \\(\\tau\\)\n\n\\(r = \\frac{\\pi u}{a_1}\\)\n\\(\\pi = \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}\\)"

To do so, we must first define the saving and investment functions.\n\n7.3.1 Saving function\nThe saving function is essentially the same as in the NKMs: all savings come out of profits (no savings out of wages):\n\\[\\sigma = s_rr\\] Assuming that:\n\nAll savings come out of profits\nClosed economy (no foreign trade)\nNo government\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Investment function\nUnlike the saving function, the Neo-Kaleckian function has a major difference with NKMs. The difference is that investment is now not only a positive function of actual profits \\(r\\), but also of the capacity rate of utilization \\(u\\):\n\\[g = g_0+g_1r+g_2u\\]\nRecall that the Neo-Robinsonian model considered that investment was a positive function, not of realized profits, but of expected profits. The Neo-Kaleckian model considers that investment if a positive function of actual profits because the latter influences investment decisions by relieving financial and liquidity constraints.\nRegarding the capacity rate \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), if this variable increases (meaning that a given firm is utilizing more unused capital, for instance to catch up with a rise in demand), firms will want to invest more to keep excess capacity (recall that firms in this model want to keep a certain level of excess capacity, the reasons are listed at the beginning).\nReplacing \\(u\\) using the profit equation \\(r = \\frac{\\pi u}{a_1}\\), the investment function can be written as a function of profit rate and profit share:\n\\[g = g_0+(g_1+g_2a_1/\\pi)r\\]\n\n\n7.3.3 Saving-Investment Equilibrium\n\n7.3.3.1 Deriving Equilibrium\nEqualizing Investment and Savings equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\sigma = g\n\\]\nReplacing \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(g\\) by their respective definition, we get:\n\\[s_rr= g_0+g_1r+g_2u\\]\nThen we replace the profit rate \\(r\\) by \\(\\frac{\\pi u}{a_1}\\):\n\\[s_r\\frac{\\pi u}{a_1}= g_0+g_1\\frac{\\pi u}{a_1}+g_2u\\]\nSolving for (isolating on the left) the capacity rate \\(u\\), we get:\n\\[\nu^* = \\frac{g_0}{(s_r-g_1)(\\pi/a_1)-g_2}\n\\]\nThe equilibrium capacity rate is thus a positive function of \\(g_0\\) (firms’ confidence in the economy), of \\(g_2\\) (effect of a one unit increase in \\(u\\) on investment), of \\(g_1\\) (degree of positive response of profit rate on investment)\nOn the other hand, \\(u^*\\) is negative function of \\(\\pi\\) (profit share), and of \\(a_1\\) (and thus positive function of labor productivity \\(1/a_1\\)).\nThe equilibrium profit rate is:\n\\[\nr^* = \\frac{g_0 (\\pi / a_1)}{(s_r-g_1)(\\pi / a_1)-g_2}\n\\]\nThe latter increase with: \\(g_0, g_1, g_2\\) and decrease with \\(s_r\\).\nEquilibrium savings and investment are:\n\\[\ng^*=\\sigma^*=\\frac{s_r g_0(\\pi/a_1)}{(s_r-g_1)(\\pi /a_1)-g_2}\n\\]\nWhich are thus positive functions of \\(g_0, g_1, g_2\\)\n\n\n7.3.3.2 Vizualizing Equilibrium\nThe Neo-Kaleckian model can be graphed using the three main equations of the model:\n\nReal Wage: \\(w = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0} \\frac{r}{u}\\)\nSavings: \\(\\sigma = s_rr\\)\nInvestment: \\(g = g_0+(g_1+g_2a_1/\\pi)r\\)\n\n\n\n\nKalecki-Steindl growth model equilibrium (Blecker and Setterfield , 2018: 176)\n\n\nSome remarks about the graph above and the main equations:\n\nThe more firms have excess capacity, the more \\(u\\) will be inferior to one, and the more the curve on the left (wage-profit curve) will rotate down to the right (because the intercept on the r axis will go down).\nRates of utilization \\(u\\) , profit rate \\(r\\) and real wage \\(w\\) are mutually and simultaneously determined.\nA rise in profit share \\(\\pi\\) will make the investment curve rotate to the left.\nA rise or fall in wage and profit share depends on technology and markup."

    "text": "7.4 Main Results of the Neo-Kaleckian model\nThe main implication of the Neo-Kaleckian (Kalecki-Steindl) model is that faster economic growth can be achieved through a more equal distribution of income, rising real wage and profit rates. These conclusions of the model are very different from CMMs and NKMs, in which faster growth can only happen with greater inequality.\nThis stand is sharp contrast with the CMMs and NKMs, which tell that faster growth comes at the expense of real wages, wage share and thus with more inequality. The difference lies in the fact that, in most CMMs and NKMs, the rate of capacity utilization is considered constant at full level \\(u = 1\\), so that a simultaneous increase in profit rates, real wage and growth can happen only if there is technological change (except a Marx-biased technological change), which is also considered exogenous.\nThis Neo-Kaleckian model thus implies that growth can be wage-led, which means that faster growth can be achieved with a more equal distribution of income: higher real wage and wage share allow for faster growth. We arrived to this result mainly by introducing markups in the model and a flexible capacity rate.\nBut what is the logic behind wage-led growth? Think for example of what would happen if the profit share rises in an economy. A rise in profit share implies a redistribution of income from wages to profits. Since, in this model, 100% of wages are consumed whereas only a fraction of profits are consumed (\\(1-s_r\\)), a rise in profit share reduces total consumption demand in the economy. A fall in consumption demand will then slow down growth, because there are less outlets for finished products and services to be sold and consumed. Note that this mechanism looks a lot to underconsumption theory expressed by some Marxists.\nKeep in mind that it could be possible for a fall consumption (due to a fall in real wage) to be offset by a rise in investment (firms have more income, and thus can invest more). In this model, not only this is not possible, but if the profit share rises (and wage share declines), even investment itself falls because of a fall in utilization rate and realized profits. This is a paradoxical result in which there is an inverse relationship between profit share and profit rates. Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) argue that the specification of the investment function, which double counts the capacity rate, is the reason behind this paradox. But logically, this paradox is due to the fact that, when profit share \\(\\pi\\) rises, the negative effect of the decline in consumption demand out of wages is so strong that capacity rate \\(u\\) falls more than profit share \\(\\pi\\) rises, making the profit rate \\(r = \\pi u/a_1\\) fall.\nThe graph below shows the negative effect of rise in the profit share. The investment curve \\(g\\) rotates to the left and the wage-profit curve rotates down to the right:\n\n\n\nBlecker and Setterfield (2018, 180)"

    "text": "7.5 Conclusion\nThis Neo-Kaleckian model, also called Kalecki-Steindl model, has strong differences with CMMs and NKMs. First, the rate of capacity utilization \\(u = Y/Y_k\\) is considered flexible, inferior to one, and has a positive impact on investment. Second, the model defines prices and profit share as positive functions of markup \\(\\tau\\), which depends on the five factors listed at the beginning of this chapter. A higher markup leads to higher profit share, lower growth, real wage, wage share, utilization rate, and higher unemployment. The model introduces two important assumptions/ideas: (1) flexible capacity rate and (2) markup pricing.\nFinally, the Kalecki-Steindl model is a good illustration of the negative effects of the increase in industrial concentration (increase in monopoly, decrease in competition) and that the latter can lead to economic stagnation. Regarding the effect of an increase in propensity to save \\(s_r\\), or a rise in confidence \\(g_0\\), the model leads to conclusions similar (but not totally) to NKMs: a rise in \\(s_r\\) (propensity to save out of profits) reduces equilibrium level of capacity rate \\(u^*\\), profit rate \\(r^*\\), and investment \\(g^*\\). An increase in \\(g_0\\) has the opposite effects. The difference with NKMs is that \\(u\\) is affected in this Kalecki-Steindl model, but is not in the NKMs.\nIn the next chapter, we will see models which are developments of this basic Neo-Kaleckian model.

    "text": "6.1 Roy Harrod: a Model of Unstable Growth\nRoy Forbes Harrod (1900-1978) is an important figure in economics. The British economist is first and foremost known for his formal description of the mechanisms of economic growth, which one of the first attempt to do so in the discipline. As we will see, the conclusion of Harrod’s model is that growth under capitalism is fundamentally unstable.\n\n6.1.1 Three Growth Rates, First and Second Harrod Problems\nHarrod distiguished three growth rates:\n\nThe actual growth rate\nThe rate of growth which is actually observed in the economy \\(y = \\frac{Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t}}\\)\nNatural growth rate\nWhich is defined as \\(y_N = q + n\\), with n the rate of growth of labour and q the rate of growth of labor productivity.\n\nThis rate of growth comes from the definition of ouput at the full-employment level: \\(Y_N = \\frac{N}{a_0}\\) with \\(a_0 = \\frac{N}{Y}\\) the labour-output ratio (how much labour is required per unit of output). The rate of change of \\(Y_N\\) is \\(\\widehat{Y_N} = n - \\widehat{a_0}\\). Since \\(a_0\\) is also the inverse of labour productivity \\(\\frac{1}{a_0} = Y/L\\), \\(-\\widehat{a}\\) is equivalent to labour productivity growth \\(\\widehat{Q} = q\\).\nThis natural rate of growth can be interpreted as an upper limit, the maximum rate of growth that can be achieved in the long run at full employment. The limit comes from the fact that production (output level) is limited by labour supply constraint (since \\(Y_N\\) is the maximum level of output at full-employment).\n\nWarranted rate of growth\nWhich is the rate of growth when investment is equal to savings \\(S = I\\).\n\nHow can we found this third rate of growth? We must first define the investment function (how the model thinks investment decisions are made):\n\\[\nI_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\]\nWith \\(I_t\\) investment at period \\(t\\), \\(a1\\) the full-capacity capital–output ratio (quantity of capital required to produce any given level of output) \\(a_1 = \\frac{K}{Y_K}\\). This ratio can also be interpreted here as the additional quantity of capital needed to produce any additional output (the “at the margins” interpretation). This equation simply means that if agents at time \\(t-1\\) expect output a the next period \\(t\\) to be higher, \\(Y^e_t &gt; Y_{t-1}\\), then investment at the next period \\(t\\) will be equal this this positive difference multiplied by the full-capacity capital–output ratio.\nWhy multiply by \\(a_1\\) ? If we define the actual quantity of capital which is utilized in the economy as \\(K_u = uK\\), \\(u\\) being the full capacity utilization rate \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), we can rewrite the actual quantity of utilized capital as \\(K_u = uK = \\frac{Y}{Y_k}K = a_1Y\\)\nThe change of the amount of capital actually used in the production process is thus \\(\\Delta{K_u} = a_1\\Delta{Y}\\)\nInvestment basically means that new capital is bought and added to the stock of capital available for production: \\(I = \\Delta{K}\\), so that when investment occurs, capital stock increases by \\(\\Delta K\\). If we consider that expectations are realized, \\(\\Delta{Y} = \\Delta{Y^e}\\), we can write\n\\[\nI = \\Delta K = a_1\\Delta Y = \\Delta K_u = a_1\\Delta{Y}\n\\] Thus, \\(a_1\\) is not arbitrary, but conformed to the known quantity of capital required to expand production through investment.\nWe have thus the investment function:\n\\[\nI_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\] The saving function, on the other hand, is equal to:\n\\[\nS_t = sY_t\n\\]\nWith \\(s\\) the propensity to save. This saving function simply means that the total saving is a fixed proportion of total income (production).\nThe last steps to find the warranted rate of growth is to equate the savings and investment function, after making the assumption that expectations are realized:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_t = Y^e_t\n\\\\\nS_t = I_t\n\\\\\ns_tY = a_1(Y_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\\\\n\\frac{s}{a_1} = \\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe warranted rate of growth is thus\n\\[y_w = \\frac{s}{a_1}\\]\nTo sum up, the three rates of growth are\n\nActual Growth Rate\n\n\\(y = \\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\\)\n\nNatural Growth Rate\n\n\\(y_n = q + n\\)\n\nWarranted Growth Rate\n\n\\(y_w = \\frac{s}{a_1}\\)\n\n\n6.1.2 The First Harrod Problem\nThe first Harrod problem states that there is no mechanisms that would ensure a persistent or non-accidental equality between the three growth rates, thus the equality\n\\[\ny = \\frac{s}{a_1} = \\bar{q} + \\bar{n}\n\\] is possible, but as the manual puts it, not likely. The reason is that what influences the warranted rate of growth and the natural rate of growth are independent of each other.\n\n\n6.1.3 The Second Harrod Problem\nThe second Harrod problem states that the warranted rate of growth \\(y_w = s/a_1\\) is unstable. That means that any deviation of the rate of growth from the warranted rate will be self-reinforcing.\nTo see this, we start with the equality between savings and investment:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nI = S\n\\\\\nI_t = sY_t\n\\\\\nY_t = \\frac{I_t}{s}\n\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen by substituting \\(I_t\\) by the investment function \\(I_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\\):\n\\[\nY_t = \\frac{a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})}{s} = \\frac{Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}}{y_w}\n\\] Note that here \\(a_1/s\\) is the inverse of the warranted rate of growth \\(y_w\\), this is why \\(y_w\\) appears at the denominator. If we divide both sides of the equation above by the expected rate of growth \\(Y^e_t\\), we get:\n\\[\\frac{Y_t}{y^e_t} = \\frac{y^e}{y_w}\\]\n\\(y^e\\) comes from the fact that we divided \\(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}\\) by \\(Y^e_t\\), which is the rate of growth of expected growth rate. This equation above simply shows that, if expectations are realized (\\(Y_t = Y^e_t\\), this is a condition for the warranted rate of growth), and \\(y^e = y_w\\), then we have an equilibrium between the actual growth rate and warranted growth rate\n\\[y^e = y = y_w\\]\nThe second Harrod problem explains that any deviation of \\(y\\) from \\(y_w\\) will be self-reinforcing. If \\(y&lt;y_w\\), there will be a downwards pressure on \\(y\\), thus a persistent recession. Conversely, if \\(y&gt;y_w\\), there will be an upwards pressure on \\(y\\), hence a self-reinforcing economic expansion.\nThese mechanisms are the results of how the model conceive the change of the expected growth rate \\(y^e_t\\). If at period \\(t\\) the growth rate \\(y_t\\) is greater than the expected growth rate \\(y_t&gt;y^e_t\\), then at period \\(t+1\\) agents will revise their expected growth rate upward \\(y^e_{t+1} &gt; y^e_t\\). This simple behavioral principle can be summarized as:\n\\[y_t &gt; y^e_t \\Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} &gt;y^e_t\\]\n\\[y_t &lt; y^e_t \\Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} &lt;y^e_t\\]\n\n\n\nInstability of the Warranted rate of Growth\n\n\nThe graph above shows that any deviation from the equilibrium point, at which \\(y_w = y = y^e\\) will lead either to permanent boom or bust. Note that the second Harrod problem depends on how expectations are revised: here we consider expectations as adaptive: expectations will be based on what happened at the previous period.\n\n\n6.1.4 Interactions between actual, warranted and natural growth rates\nTwo scenarios can be considered.\nFirst, when \\(y_w&lt;y_N\\), the economy will be prone to boom and bust behavior. If the actual growth rate is greater than the warranted growth rate, the former will be ever-increasing until the economy will “overheat” when the actual growth rate is superior to the natural rate (which is an upper limit above which there will be exhaustion of labor force and a likely wage-inflation spiral).\nSecond, if \\(y_w&gt;y_N\\), the economy is in a situation of chronic depression. Since the actual growth rate cannot be permanently equal to the warranted rate in this situation (because of the upper limit \\(y_N\\)), the actual rate of growth would tend to permanently fall until government policies would likely start to intervene.\nFinally, this model has consequence for economic policy. Increasing the saving propensity \\(s\\) to boost growth is not a good idea if it is not accompanied by a rise in aggregate demand, in which case increased saving means reduced consumption demand and investment demand is not guaranteed to offset the fall in consumption."

    "text": "6.2 The Early Kaldorian Model (EKM) of Growth and Distribution\n\n6.2.1 A model very close to the Classical-Marxian model\nThis model is very close to the Classical-Marxian model I described here. The main difference is the fact that the early Kaldorian model (EKM) includes the saving propensity out of wages \\(s_w\\) whereas the classical-marxian model only includes savings out of profits.\nRecall that the classical-marxian saving function was\n\\(S/K= s_r(r-r_min)\\)\nThe EKM introduces savings out of wages, with a propensity lower than savings out of profits. Total savings is thus a weighted average bewteen savings out of wages and profits:\n\\[S = [(1-\\pi)s_w+\\pi s_r]Y\\]\n\\(\\pi\\) is the profit share, \\((1-\\pi)\\) the wage share, with \\(0&lt;s_w &lt; s_r&lt;1\\).\n\n\n6.2.2 EKM Assumptions\nThe model makes some assumptions, which are globally similar to the C-M model:\n\nEKM assumes that labor productivity is constant \\(q=0\\), hence the natural rate of growth is simply \\(y_N=n\\).\nLike the Classical-Marxian model, growth rate is the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta K/K\\).\nFull or constant capacity rate of utilization \\(u\\)\nConstancy and exogenous capital-output and labor-output ratios \\(a_0,a_1\\)\n\nTo maintain full employment, capital accumulate rate must grow the same as the investment rate and labor supply growth rate:\n\\(g = \\frac{I}{K} = n\\)\n\n\n6.2.3 EKM Equilibrium\nAs usual, we equate \\(S = I\\), to find the equilibrium:\n\\[g = n = \\frac{I}{K} = \\frac{S}{K} = \\frac{[(1-\\pi)s_w+\\pi s_r]Y}{K} = \\frac{(s_r-s_w)\\pi + s_w}{a_1}\\]\nThe equilibrium profit share is thus\n\\[\\pi^* = \\frac{a_1 n - s_w}{s_r - s_w}\\]\nAnd the equilibrium growth rate is\n\\[g^* = n = \\frac{s^*}{a_1}\\]\nA major difference with the C-M model is that instead of considering an exogenous wage share or real wage and deriving the profit rate and growth rate from it, Kaldor set the growth rate equal to its natural rate and derive the profit/wage share and saving propensity necessary to reach this equilibrium. For the EKM to work, wage and profit shares must be flexible, there must be active government stabilization policies (fiscal & monetary).\nEKM has the implications that for the economy to grow faster only with higher inequality."

    "section": "6.3 Neo-Robinsonian Model",
    "text": "6.3 Neo-Robinsonian Model\nThe major point of this model is to introduce a separation between investment and savings. All the models we saw until now did not distinguish between savings and investment (as the classical-marxian model).\n\n6.3.1 Separating Savings from Investment\nThe main equations of the model are thus a saving function out of profits and a desired investment as a positive function of expected profits.\n\nSaving function\n\n\\[\\sigma = s_rr\\] With \\(\\sigma\\) savings.\n\nDesired investment function\n\n\\[g = f(r^e)\\]\n\\(g\\) being investment. This function is assumed to have positive but diminishing marginal impact of expected profits on desired investment (\\(f'&gt;0, f''&lt;0\\)).\n\n\n\nRobinson “banana diagram”\n\n\nPoint A on the graph above is a stable equilibrium whereas point B is an unstable one. The graph has to be read as follows: at \\(r_0\\) the saving rate is smaller than the (desired) growth rate \\(g_0\\). At \\(g_0\\), the corresponding profit rate is \\(r_1\\), which is above the profit rate related to actual saving rate (\\(r_0\\)). Firms have thus invested in way that will make profits rise and they will thus revise their profits expectations upwards: at \\(r_1\\) they will invest at a level slighlty above \\(g_0\\), which will again push up the profit rate until point A, at which \\(g=\\sigma\\) is reached.\nOn the other hand, if we start at any profit rate below point B, the desired rate of investment will lead to a growth rate that will lead in return to a lower profit rate, firms will revise their profit rate expectations downwards and thus reduce their desired rate of investment, which will then lead to an even lower growth and profit rates and so on. Below point B, this process does not end automatically, there must be for example government stabilization. Above point A, however, the process is the same as described above in this paragraph, but it stabilizes at point A. Note that what happens below point B is strongly similar to the second Harrod problem.\n\n\n6.3.2 Connecting Neo-Robinsonian Model with Wage-Profit Relationship\nThe Neo-Robinsonian model combines the model above with the inverse wage-profit relationship we saw in the C-M model. The desired investment rate is simplified to\n\\(g = f_0+f_1r^e\\)\nWith the same saving function \\(\\sigma = s_rr\\) and the inverse profit-wage relationship \\(w =\\frac{1-a_1 r}{a_0}\\)\nTo find the equilibrium levels of growth, profit and wage rates, we set investment equals to savings \\(\\sigma = g\\) and solve for:\n\\[r^* = \\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1}\\]\nand\n\\[g^*=\\frac{s_rf_0}{s_r-f_1}\\]\nand\n\\[w^* = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0}(\\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1})\\]\nNote that in this model the real wage and wage share are flexible, but nominal wage is not.\n\n\n\nNeo-robinsonian model\n\n\nIn this model, an increase in the propensity to save leads to lower equilibrium level of growth and profit rates and a higher equilibrium real wage. The mechanism is that an increase in the propensity to save, with an unchanged desired investment curve (which means that saving propensity increases without changing firms’ willingness to invest), reduces aggregate demand through a reduction in consumption demand. With falling demand, profits realized from actual investment expenditures also fall.\n\n\n\nEffect of an increase in saving propensity\n\n\nGraphically, the saving curve rotates down to the right. Why does the real wage increase? Recall that in this model, nominal wage is fixed. A change in real wage must then come from a change in the price level. In the case of higher propensity to save, the latter has depressed aggregate demand and growth, which reduces the price level \\(\\searrow P\\).\nWhat if we consider a shift in the desired investment curve? An example would be a rise in \\(f_0\\), which can be interpreted as the level of confidence of firms: the higher their confidence in the economy, the higher they will invest for every level of expected profit rates. A rise in \\(f_0\\) would shift the desired investment curve \\(g = f_0+f_1r\\) to the right, profit rate would rise, growth rate would rise, but real wage would decrease. Real wage decreases because inflation increases as a result of higher aggregate demand and thus excess demand in the goods market. Note that inflation in the neo-Robinsonian model is always “demand-pushed”, that is, led by excess demand in the market for goods and services."

    "text": "6.4 Marglin’s neo-Marxian/neo-Keynesian synthesis\nSince the assumption of fixed nominal was considered not very realistic, since it is very likely that workers would bargain for higher nominal wages in the case of higher inflation as described above, Marglin has constructed model which is a mix between the classical-marxian model and the neo-robinsonian model. Marglin’s contribution was to consider that workers bargain for nominal wages rather than the real wage or wage share.\nMarglin’s synthesis adds two functions, which model the change in nominal wage and price level.\n\n6.4.1 Change in nominal wage\n\\(\\hat{W} = \\Omega (\\bar{w} - w)\\)\nWith \\(\\bar{w}\\) the target real wage for workers and \\(\\Omega\\) a constant describing how fast change in nominal wage adjusts to the difference between the target real wage and the real wage \\((\\bar{w} - w)\\). If the target real wage is greater than the actual real wage, workers are willing and are able to bargain for higher wages.\n\n\n6.4.2 Change in price\n\\(\\hat{P} = \\Phi (g^d-g)\\)\nWith\n\\(g^d = f_0 + f_1r\\) (assuming \\(r^e = r\\))\nThe desired investment function, which means that the desired investment rate (\\(g^d\\)) is a positive function of the profit rate (assumed to be equal to the expected rate).\nAnd\n\\(g = s_rr\\)\nThe saving function, which is also a positive function of profit rate.\nThus, \\(\\hat{P} = \\Phi (g^d-g)\\), means that inflation (persistent change in price level: \\(\\hat{P}\\)) is always the result of excess demand in the goods market, excess demand due to the fact that \\(g^d&gt;g\\), demand related to investment (demand for tools, machinery, equipment…).\nThis price level change equation captures an important assumption of the neo-keynesian models that inflation is always “demand-led”, that is, led by excessive demand in the goods market. Another assumption is the constancy of the capital to full capacity output ratio \\(a_1\\) (constant technology).\n\n\n6.4.3 Dynamics of the Model\nThe equilibrium condition of the model, which will determine growth, real wage and profit rate, is the equality between price change and nominal wage change:\n\\[\\widehat{W} = \\widehat{P}\\]\n\n\n\nMarglin’s Classical-Marxian - NeoRobinsonian synthesis\n\n\nAt this equilibrium, the real wage \\(W/P\\) is constant. The other variables behave as such:\n\nIf the target real wage increase \\(\\bar{w}\\), equilibrium profit rate decreases, real wage increases, growth rate decreases and equilibrium inflation increases.\nIf \\(f_0\\), firms’ confidence in the economy, increases, equilibrium inflation increases, equilibrium profit rate and growth rate also increase and equilibrium real wage decreases.\nIf the propensity \\(s_r\\) to save increases, equilibrium profit rate and inflation decrease, but the impact on growth is ambiguous: on the one hand growth is constrained by available savings (and thus if savings increase growth can increase) but on the other hand, growth can also decrease because of the fall in profit rate.\n\nAn important contribution of this model is to make explicit the argument about inflation, which was only implicit in the previous neo-keynesian models (Robinson, Kaldor…). An crucial point is that the model assumes that inflation is always driven by demand (excess demand in the goods market). A critic adressed to this model is that inflation is not only “demand-pull” but can also be “cost-push”, that is, driven positively by an increase in firms’ markups due to an increase in costs.\nAnother critic concerns that inflation caused by the difference between \\(g^d&gt;g\\) is not very realistic because it implies that firms will always want to invest at a rate they cannot achieve."

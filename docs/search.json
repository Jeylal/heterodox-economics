    "text": "What follows is extensively based on the second chapter of Heterodox Macroeconomics: Models of of Demand, Distribution and Growth (2019) by Robert A. Blecker and Mark Setterfield\n\n2.0.1 Assumptions of the model\nThe classical-marxian model, named after Smith, Ricardo (who are considered as classics) and marx and based on their important work, comes its specific assumptions:\n\nConstant or full capacity rate of utilization.\n\nThe latter, \\(u = \\frac{Y}{Y_{K}}\\), is ratio of the actual output (GDP) divided by the full capacity output \\(Y_K\\), which is the level if output if all capital in the economy was used at its full capacity (no unused machines, raw materials…). If this ratio is equal to one, that means that the economy is at full capacity, the actual output is equal to its capacity level. If the ratio is for example 0.5, that means that actual output is half its level if all capital was fully used. But why does this model make such an assumption? This assumption stands in sharp contrast with the (neo)kaleckian model which typically reverses this assumption stating that capacity rate \\(u\\) is an important adjusting variable.\nBefore explaining the reason behind this assumption, it is necessary to understand the classical-marxian conception of the production process (how inputs, capital and labor, are combined to produce either goods or services), which rests on the Leontieff production function. The latter can be written as\n\\[\nY = min(\\frac{N}{a_0}, \\frac{K}{a_1})\n\\]\nWith N and K respectively labor and capital, \\(a_0 = L/Y\\) the labour-output ratio (the quantity of labour required to produce one unit of ouput) and \\(a_1 = K/Y\\) the quantity of capital required to produce one unit of output (capital-output ratio).\n\n# how to write the leontief production function in R\nleontief &lt;- function(l, k, a0, a1) (min(c(l/a0, k/a1)))\n\n\\(\\frac{N}{a_0}\\) is the maximum output that can be produced with available labour resources while \\(\\frac{K}{a_1}\\) represents maximum output when all capital resources are used.\nFor instance, if three units of labor are required to produce one unit of output and one unit of capital is required to produce one unit of output, what will be produced if we have N = 9 and K = 4 ?\nIn our example, \\(a_0 = 3/1\\) (three units of labor required to produce Y = 1) and \\(a_1 = 1\\) (one unit of capital to produce one unit). We compute \\(N/a_0 = 9/3\\) and \\(K/a_1 = 4/1\\). Since the former \\(9/3 = 3\\) is bigger than \\(4\\), all 9 units of labor will be used to produce 3 units of output. Note that at Y = 3, one unit of capital will be leftover and be unused. In this example, output is “labor-constrained” because it is the amount of labor which is fully used and capital which is not. Output at full employment is \\(Y_N = N/a_0\\).\n\nleontief(l = 9, k = 4, a0 = 3, a1 = 1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nConsidering labor as the constraint is what the (neo)kaleckian model does, while the classical-marxian model considers that capital is the binding constraint on potential output. In the classical-marxian model, all capital is used and thus output is output at full capital utilization \\(Y_K = K/a_1\\).\nWhile both classical-marxian and (neo)kaleckian models use Leontief production function (and are here different from neoclassical models which use cobb-douglas production function), they differ by what they consider as the constraining factor on output: labor for (neo)kaleckian model \\(Y_N\\), capital for classical-marxian model \\(Y_k\\).\nThus, considering that capital is the constraint implies the possibility to consider that the economy can reach a full capacity utilization \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), this is what the classical-marxian model does thus why \\(u\\) is considered constant at full capacity \\(u = 1\\).\n\nConstant and Given Technology\n\nThere is no technological change in the classical-marxian model. However, the effects of exogenous technological change can still be analyzed.\n\n\n2.0.2 Basis of the model\n\n2.0.2.1 Wage-profit trade-off\nThe main equation is derived from the income approach to national income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is the sum of all income sources in the economy. The model makes here other assumptions: no government, closed economy, only workers and capitalists, only one good produced, which are nessecary to write:\n\\[\nPY = WL + rPK\n\\] Which is the national income identity after those assumptions, with \\(P\\) the price, \\(Y\\) the output, \\(W\\) the nominal wage rate, \\(L\\) the amount of labor employed, \\(r\\) the profit rate and \\(K\\) the real stock of capital.\nFrom this equation above is derived one the main equation of the model, the inverse wage-profit relationship:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nw &lt;- function(r) 40 -1*r\n\nggplot(data = tibble(x = 0:10), aes(x = x))+\n  geom_function(fun = w)+\n  annotate(geom = \"label\", x = 7.5, y = 40, label = \"w = 1/a0 - (a1/a0)*r\", color = \"red\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(title = \"Inverse wage-profit relationship\",\n       x = \"profit rate (r)\", y = \"real wage\")\n\n\n\n\nThis equation also implies an inverse relationship between consumption and growth\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\] With \\(c\\) consumption of both workers and capitalist and \\(g\\) the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta{K}/K = I/K\\)\nThese two relationships and hence trade-off between wage and profit, and consumption and growth are the implications of the two main assumptions explained above: constant rate of capacity utilization and given constant technology. Technological change or rise in \\(u\\) can improve the wage-profit trade-off and thus make both profits and wage rate rise (same for consumption-growth trade-off). Graphically, the slope of the curve above would either shift upward or one of the intercept increase.\n\n\n2.0.2.2 Saving function\nThe model makes here another important assumption: all saving is done by the capitalist class. All savings come out from of the profits received by the capitalists. Another important feature is the fact that the classics and Marx did not distinguish between savings and investment (“the purchase of newly produced capital goods, such as machinery, equipment or structures”(p.63)). In C-M terminology, “accumulation” means the mechanistic flow between savings, investment and thus growth. This leads to the “accumulation function”:\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\]\n\\(g \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K\\) (growth \\(g\\) is equal to the investment rate \\(I/K\\) which is the same as saving rate \\(S/K\\)) comes from this non-distinction between saving and investment. \\(s_r\\) is the proportion capitalists save out of their profits \\(r\\). This equation means that growth can increase only with an increase in the saving rate of the capitalists.\n\n\n\n2.0.3 The three equations and the alternative closures\n\n2.0.3.1 3 Equations\nThe basic model is thus based on the three main equations\n\nProfit-wage trade-off\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nConsumption-growth trade-off\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\]\n\nAccumulation function\n\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\] However, the model is not “closed” in the sense that all the main variables (w, r, s_r, g) are endogenous (they all are a function of one another). The model needs thus to be “closed” by adding an exogenous variable. Since the classics and Marx did not give a precise and consistent closure (exogenous variable), the textbook gives four “alternative closures” which come from different interpretation the classics and Marx.\n\n\n2.0.3.2 4 alternative closures\n\nAn exogenously given real wage \\(\\bar{w}\\)\n\nWhich represents an ordinary standard of living for a working-class family. This should not be confounded with the infamous “iron law” of wages (that wages will always tend to go to the subsistence level, this was made popular by Ferdinand Lassalle and Malthus but has nothing to do with Marx and the classics). This exogenous wage rate \\(\\bar{w}\\) is given, but socially and historically determined and varies across countries and time. This is not a natural/physical minium subsistence wage.\n\nExogenous given wage share of national income\n\nThis assumes that wages are determined through a bargaining process in which workers can bargain with capitalists to get wages such as a given wage share of national income is achieved. Note that the wage share can be written as \\(\\psi = wa_0 = w*L/Y\\) and the profit share \\(\\pi = ra_1=rK/Y\\). The real wage \\(w\\) can be written as negatively related to the profit share \\(\\pi\\)\n\\[\nw = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})/a_0 = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})Q\n\\] With \\(Q=Y/L\\) labour productivity.\n\nFull employment or constant employment\n\nThis closures explains that wage depends on the balance between labor demand and supply. Increase in labor demand tend to increase wages whereas the growth in labor supply will tend to decrease wages. A rapid growth of labor demand increase the bargaining power of workers, who can bargain higher wages and conversely when population and labor supply increase rapidly.\nThis closure states that the change in real wage \\(\\hat{w}\\) is a negative function of growth in labour supply \\(n\\)\n\\(\\hat{w} = \\phi(g - n), \\phi'&gt;0\\)\nThus, wage is constant when \\(g = n\\)\nBut then, the manual (on page 71) considers another function, which describes the growth of labor force \\(n\\) as a positive function of real rage \\(w\\), the idea is that the higher wage leads to higher population growth and thus higher labor supply growth:\n\\(n = n_0 + n_1w\\)\n\nA given rate of profit, determined by financial market forces\n\nThe profit rate is determined by the interest rate on loans to firms \\(i\\) and by a risk premium \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\(r = i + \\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.4 Effects of exogenous change\n\n2.0.4.1 Vizualization of the models\n\n\n2.0.4.2 First and second closures\n\n\n\nThe model under first and second closures (exogenous real wage or wage share),Blecker and Setterfield (2019, 69)\n\n\n\n\n2.0.4.3 Third closure\n\n\n\nThird closure: constant of full employment rate, Blecker and Stterfield (2019, 72)\n\n\nSince the fourth closure is in my opinion not really important, I will mostly focus now of those closures above.\n\n\n2.0.4.4 Effects of exogenous change in propensity to save\nWhat happens if the saving propensity out of profits, \\(s_r\\), rise or fall?\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nIf the propsensity to save increase, the accumulation function curve becomes flatter (attention: in the graph above, the y and x axis are inverted on the right quadrant, where the accumulation function is drawn. So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve). Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.\n\n\\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow I/K \\Rightarrow \\nearrow g, \\searrow c\\)\n\nClosure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)\nAn increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and will return at its original level.\nEndogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g, \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow n \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\),\nbut with final g &gt; initial g. Note that under these conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.\nExogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.4.5 Effects of redistribution of income\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nA rise in real wage or wage share would decrease the profit rate (recall the trade-off between wage and profit), which would decrease the growth rate (less is saved and invested since profits decrease). Consumption rises due to the increase in real wage/wage share\n\n\\(\\nearrow \\bar{w} \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow c\\)\nA decrease in real wage or wage share would have the opposite effects.\n\nClosure 3 natural rate of growth\nIn this closure, a change in real wage or wage share would be the effect of an exognous change in population growth (and thus of labor supply). A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the 14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity). The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.\n\n\\(\\nearrow n_0 \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\nearrow c \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.5 Effects of technological change\nThe manual presents four types of technological change:\n\nHarrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change\nLabor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\\)\n\nHicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change\nBoth capital and labor productivity rise\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \\nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\\)\n\nMarx-biased: labor saving, capital using\nLabor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases\nSolow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change\nCapital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged\n\nAll those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise. Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.\n\n2.0.5.1 Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of the rate of profit (FTRP)\nThe FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In Capital Volume III, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a constant rate of exploitation \\(e = s/v\\) with s the surplus value and v the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage share and profit share.\nRecall that the profit share can be written as \\(r = \\pi / a_1\\), if \\(\\pi\\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological change happens, \\(a_1\\) will increase (\\(a_1\\) is the inverse of capital productivity \\(a_1 = K/Y_k\\)). and thus decrease profit rate \\(r\\). Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.\nWhat about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot change: \\(a_0\\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus \\(\\pi = 1-wa_0\\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure, but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share decreases)."

However, the effects of exogenous technological change can still be analyzed.\n\n\n3.0.2 Basis of the model\n\n3.0.2.1 Wage-profit trade-off\nThe main equation is derived from the income approach to national income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is the sum of all income sources in the economy.

So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve). Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.\n\n\\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow I/K \\Rightarrow \\nearrow g, \\searrow c\\)\n\nClosure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)\nAn increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and will return at its original level.\nEndogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g, \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow n \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\),\nbut with final g &gt; initial g. Note that under these conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.\nExogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.4.5 Effects of redistribution of income\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nA rise in real wage or wage share would decrease the profit rate (recall the trade-off between wage and profit), which would decrease the growth rate (less is saved and invested since profits decrease). Consumption rises due to the increase in real wage/wage share\n\n\\(\\nearrow \\bar{w} \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow c\\)\nA decrease in real wage or wage share would have the opposite effects.\n\nClosure 3 natural rate of growth\nIn this closure, a change in real wage or wage share would be the effect of an exognous change in population growth (and thus of labor supply). A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the 14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity). The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.\n\n\\(\\nearrow n_0 \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\nearrow c \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n3.0.5 Effects of technological change\nThe manual presents four types of technological change:\n\nHarrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change\nLabor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\\)\n\nHicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change\nBoth capital and labor productivity rise\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \\nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\\)\n\nMarx-biased: labor saving, capital using\nLabor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases\nSolow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change\nCapital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged\n\nAll those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise. Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.\n\n3.0.5.1 Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of the rate of profit (FTRP)\nThe FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In Capital Volume III, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a constant rate of exploitation \\(e = s/v\\) with s the surplus value and v the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage share and profit share.\nRecall that the profit share can be written as \\(r = \\pi / a_1\\), if \\(\\pi\\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological change happens, \\(a_1\\) will increase (\\(a_1\\) is the inverse of capital productivity \\(a_1 = K/Y_k\\)). and thus decrease profit rate \\(r\\). Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.\nWhat about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot change: \\(a_0\\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus \\(\\pi = 1-wa_0\\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure, but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share decreases)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What follows is extensively based on the second chapter of Heterodox Macroeconomics: Models of of Demand, Distribution and Growth (2019) by Robert A. Blecker and Mark Setterfield\n\n2.0.1 Assumptions of the model\nThe classical-marxian model, named after Smith, Ricardo (who are considered as classics) and marx and based on their important work, comes its specific assumptions:\n\nConstant or full capacity rate of utilization.\n\nThe latter, \\(u = \\frac{Y}{Y_{K}}\\), is ratio of the actual output (GDP) divided by the full capacity output \\(Y_K\\), which is the level if output if all capital in the economy was used at its full capacity (no unused machines, raw materials…). If this ratio is equal to one, that means that the economy is at full capacity, the actual output is equal to its capacity level. If the ratio is for example 0.5, that means that actual output is half its level if all capital was fully used. But why does this model make such an assumption? This assumption stands in sharp contrast with the (neo)kaleckian model which typically reverses this assumption stating that capacity rate \\(u\\) is an important adjusting variable.\nBefore explaining the reason behind this assumption, it is necessary to understand the classical-marxian conception of the production process (how inputs, capital and labor, are combined to produce either goods or services), which rests on the Leontieff production function. The latter can be written as\n\\[\nY = min(\\frac{N}{a_0}, \\frac{K}{a_1})\n\\]\nWith N and K respectively labor and capital, \\(a_0 = L/Y\\) the labour-output ratio (the quantity of labour required to produce one unit of ouput) and \\(a_1 = K/Y\\) the quantity of capital required to produce one unit of output (capital-output ratio).\n\n# how to write the leontief production function in R\nleontief &lt;- function(l, k, a0, a1) (min(c(l/a0, k/a1)))\n\n\\(\\frac{N}{a_0}\\) is the maximum output that can be produced with available labour resources while \\(\\frac{K}{a_1}\\) represents maximum output when all capital resources are used.\nFor instance, if three units of labor are required to produce one unit of output and one unit of capital is required to produce one unit of output, what will be produced if we have N = 9 and K = 4 ?\nIn our example, \\(a_0 = 3/1\\) (three units of labor required to produce Y = 1) and \\(a_1 = 1\\) (one unit of capital to produce one unit). We compute \\(N/a_0 = 9/3\\) and \\(K/a_1 = 4/1\\). Since the former \\(9/3 = 3\\) is bigger than \\(4\\), all 9 units of labor will be used to produce 3 units of output. Note that at Y = 3, one unit of capital will be leftover and be unused. In this example, output is “labor-constrained” because it is the amount of labor which is fully used and capital which is not. Output at full employment is \\(Y_N = N/a_0\\).\n\nleontief(l = 9, k = 4, a0 = 3, a1 = 1)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nConsidering labor as the constraint is what the (neo)kaleckian model does, while the classical-marxian model considers that capital is the binding constraint on potential output. In the classical-marxian model, all capital is used and thus output is output at full capital utilization \\(Y_K = K/a_1\\).\nWhile both classical-marxian and (neo)kaleckian models use Leontief production function (and are here different from neoclassical models which use cobb-douglas production function), they differ by what they consider as the constraining factor on output: labor for (neo)kaleckian model \\(Y_N\\), capital for classical-marxian model \\(Y_k\\).\nThus, considering that capital is the constraint implies the possibility to consider that the economy can reach a full capacity utilization \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), this is what the classical-marxian model does thus why \\(u\\) is considered constant at full capacity \\(u = 1\\).\n\nConstant and Given Technology\n\nThere is no technological change in the classical-marxian model. However, the effects of exogenous technological change can still be analyzed.\n\n\n2.0.2 Basis of the model\n\n2.0.2.1 Wage-profit trade-off\nThe main equation is derived from the income approach to national income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is the sum of all income sources in the economy. The model makes here other assumptions: no government, closed economy, only workers and capitalists, only one good produced, which are nessecary to write:\n\\[\nPY = WL + rPK\n\\] Which is the national income identity after those assumptions, with \\(P\\) the price, \\(Y\\) the output, \\(W\\) the nominal wage rate, \\(L\\) the amount of labor employed, \\(r\\) the profit rate and \\(K\\) the real stock of capital.\nFrom this equation above is derived one the main equation of the model, the inverse wage-profit relationship:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nw &lt;- function(r) 40 -1*r\n\nggplot(data = tibble(x = 0:10), aes(x = x))+\n  geom_function(fun = w)+\n  annotate(geom = \"label\", x = 7.5, y = 40, label = \"w = 1/a0 - (a1/a0)*r\", color = \"red\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(title = \"Inverse wage-profit relationship\",\n       x = \"profit rate (r)\", y = \"real wage\")\n\n\n\n\nThis equation also implies an inverse relationship between consumption and growth\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\] With \\(c\\) consumption of both workers and capitalist and \\(g\\) the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta{K}/K = I/K\\)\nThese two relationships and hence trade-off between wage and profit, and consumption and growth are the implications of the two main assumptions explained above: constant rate of capacity utilization and given constant technology. Technological change or rise in \\(u\\) can improve the wage-profit trade-off and thus make both profits and wage rate rise (same for consumption-growth trade-off). Graphically, the slope of the curve above would either shift upward or one of the intercept increase.\n\n\n2.0.2.2 Saving function\nThe model makes here another important assumption: all saving is done by the capitalist class. All savings come out from of the profits received by the capitalists. Another important feature is the fact that the classics and Marx did not distinguish between savings and investment (“the purchase of newly produced capital goods, such as machinery, equipment or structures”(p.63)). In C-M terminology, “accumulation” means the mechanistic flow between savings, investment and thus growth. This leads to the “accumulation function”:\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\]\n\\(g \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K\\) (growth \\(g\\) is equal to the investment rate \\(I/K\\) which is the same as saving rate \\(S/K\\)) comes from this non-distinction between saving and investment. \\(s_r\\) is the proportion capitalists save out of their profits \\(r\\). This equation means that growth can increase only with an increase in the saving rate of the capitalists.\n\n\n\n2.0.3 The three equations and the alternative closures\n\n2.0.3.1 3 Equations\nThe basic model is thus based on the three main equations\n\nProfit-wage trade-off\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}r\n\\]\n\nConsumption-growth trade-off\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{1}{a_0}-\\frac{a_1}{a_0}g\n\\]\n\nAccumulation function\n\n\\[\ng \\equiv I/K \\equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})\n\\] However, the model is not “closed” in the sense that all the main variables (w, r, s_r, g) are endogenous (they all are a function of one another). The model needs thus to be “closed” by adding an exogenous variable. Since the classics and Marx did not give a precise and consistent closure (exogenous variable), the textbook gives four “alternative closures” which come from different interpretation the classics and Marx.\n\n\n2.0.3.2 4 alternative closures\n\nAn exogenously given real wage \\(\\bar{w}\\)\n\nWhich represents an ordinary standard of living for a working-class family. This should not be confounded with the infamous “iron law” of wages (that wages will always tend to go to the subsistence level, this was made popular by Ferdinand Lassalle and Malthus but has nothing to do with Marx and the classics). This exogenous wage rate \\(\\bar{w}\\) is given, but socially and historically determined and varies across countries and time. This is not a natural/physical minium subsistence wage.\n\nExogenous given wage share of national income\n\nThis assumes that wages are determined through a bargaining process in which workers can bargain with capitalists to get wages such as a given wage share of national income is achieved. Note that the wage share can be written as \\(\\psi = wa_0 = w*L/Y\\) and the profit share \\(\\pi = ra_1=rK/Y\\). The real wage \\(w\\) can be written as negatively related to the profit share \\(\\pi\\)\n\\[\nw = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})/a_0 = (1 - \\bar{\\pi})Q\n\\] With \\(Q=Y/L\\) labour productivity.\n\nFull employment or constant employment\n\nThis closures explains that wage depends on the balance between labor demand and supply. Increase in labor demand tend to increase wages whereas the growth in labor supply will tend to decrease wages. A rapid growth of labor demand increase the bargaining power of workers, who can bargain higher wages and conversely when population and labor supply increase rapidly.\nThis closure states that the change in real wage \\(\\hat{w}\\) is a negative function of growth in labour supply \\(n\\)\n\\(\\hat{w} = \\phi(g - n), \\phi'&gt;0\\)\nThus, wage is constant when \\(g = n\\)\nBut then, the manual (on page 71) considers another function, which describes the growth of labor force \\(n\\) as a positive function of real rage \\(w\\), the idea is that the higher wage leads to higher population growth and thus higher labor supply growth:\n\\(n = n_0 + n_1w\\)\n\nA given rate of profit, determined by financial market forces\n\nThe profit rate is determined by the interest rate on loans to firms \\(i\\) and by a risk premium \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\(r = i + \\lambda\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.4 Effects of exogenous change\n\n2.0.4.1 Vizualization of the models\n\n\n2.0.4.2 First and second closures\n\n\n\nThe model under first and second closures (exogenous real wage or wage share),Blecker and Setterfield (2019, 69)\n\n\n\n\n2.0.4.3 Third closure\n\n\n\nThird closure: constant of full employment rate, Blecker and Stterfield (2019, 72)\n\n\nSince the fourth closure is in my opinion not really important, I will mostly focus now of those closures above.\n\n\n2.0.4.4 Effects of exogenous change in propensity to save\nWhat happens if the saving propensity out of profits, \\(s_r\\), rise or fall?\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nIf the propsensity to save increase, the accumulation function curve becomes flatter (attention: in the graph above, the y and x axis are inverted on the right quadrant, where the accumulation function is drawn. So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve). Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.\n\n\\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow I/K \\Rightarrow \\nearrow g, \\searrow c\\)\n\nClosure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)\nAn increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and will return at its original level.\nEndogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g, \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow n \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\),\nbut with final g &gt; initial g. Note that under these conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.\nExogenous labor supply: \\(\\nearrow s_r \\Rightarrow \\nearrow \\nearrow g \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.4.5 Effects of redistribution of income\n\nClosure 1 and 2\nA rise in real wage or wage share would decrease the profit rate (recall the trade-off between wage and profit), which would decrease the growth rate (less is saved and invested since profits decrease).

A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the 14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity). The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.\n\n\\(\\nearrow n_0 \\Rightarrow \\nearrow w, \\nearrow c \\Rightarrow \\searrow r \\Rightarrow \\searrow g\\)\n\n\n\n2.0.5 Effects of technological change\nThe manual presents four types of technological change:\n\nHarrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change\nLabor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\\)\n\nHicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change\nBoth capital and labor productivity rise\n\n\\(\\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \\nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\\)\n\nMarx-biased: labor saving, capital using\nLabor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases\nSolow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change\nCapital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged\n\nAll those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise. Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.\n\n2.0.5.1 Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of the rate of profit (FTRP)\nThe FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In Capital Volume III, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a constant rate of exploitation \\(e = s/v\\) with s the surplus value and v the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage share and profit share.\nRecall that the profit share can be written as \\(r = \\pi / a_1\\), if \\(\\pi\\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological change happens, \\(a_1\\) will increase (\\(a_1\\) is the inverse of capital productivity \\(a_1 = K/Y_k\\)). and thus decrease profit rate \\(r\\). Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.\nWhat about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot change: \\(a_0\\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus \\(\\pi = 1-wa_0\\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure, but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share decreases)."

    "section": "3.1 Roy Harrod: a Model of Unstable Growth",
    "text": "3.1 Roy Harrod: a Model of Unstable Growth\nRoy Forbes Harrod (1900-1978) is an important figure in economics. The British economist is first and foremost known for his formal description of the mechanisms of economic growth, which one of the first attempt to do so in the discipline. As we will see, the conclusion of Harrod’s model is that growth under capitalism is fundamentally unstable.\n\n3.1.1 Three Growth Rates, First and Second Harrod Problems\nHarrod distiguished three growth rates:\n\nThe actual growth rate\nThe rate of growth which is actually observed in the economy \\(y = \\frac{Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t}}\\)\nNatural growth rate\nWhich is defined as \\(y_N = q + n\\), with n the rate of growth of labour and q the rate of growth of labor productivity.\n\nThis rate of growth comes from the definition of ouput at the full-employment level: \\(Y_N = \\frac{N}{a_0}\\) with \\(a_0 = \\frac{N}{Y}\\) the labour-output ratio (how much labour is required per unit of output). The rate of change of \\(Y_N\\) is \\(\\widehat{Y_N} = n - \\widehat{a_0}\\). Since \\(a_0\\) is also the inverse of labour productivity \\(\\frac{1}{a_0} = Y/L\\), \\(-\\widehat{a}\\) is equivalent to labour productivity growth \\(\\widehat{Q} = q\\).\nThis natural rate of growth can be interpreted as an upper limit, the maximum rate of growth that can be achieved in the long run at full employment. The limit comes from the fact that production (output level) is limited by labour supply constraint (since \\(Y_N\\) is the maximum level of output at full-employment).\n\nWarranted rate of growth\nWhich is the rate of growth when investment is equal to savings \\(S = I\\).\n\nHow can we found this third rate of growth? We must first define the investment function (how the model thinks investment decisions are made):\n\\[\nI_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\]\nWith \\(I_t\\) investment at period \\(t\\), \\(a1\\) the full-capacity capital–output ratio (quantity of capital required to produce any given level of output) \\(a_1 = \\frac{K}{Y_K}\\). This ratio can also be interpreted here as the additional quantity of capital needed to produce any additional output (the “at the margins” interpretation). This equation simply means that if agents at time \\(t-1\\) expect output a the next period \\(t\\) to be higher, \\(Y^e_t &gt; Y_{t-1}\\), then investment at the next period \\(t\\) will be equal this this positive difference multiplied by the full-capacity capital–output ratio.\nWhy multiply by \\(a_1\\) ? If we define the actual quantity of capital which is utilized in the economy as \\(K_u = uK\\), \\(u\\) being the full capacity utilization rate \\(u = Y/Y_k\\), we can rewrite the actual quantity of utilized capital as \\(K_u = uK = \\frac{Y}{Y_k}K = a_1Y\\)\nThe change of the amount of capital actually used in the production process is thus \\(\\Delta{K_u} = a_1\\Delta{Y}\\)\nInvestment basically means that new capital is bought and added to the stock of capital available for production: \\(I = \\Delta{K}\\), so that when investment occurs, capital stock increases by \\(\\Delta K\\). If we consider that expectations are realized, \\(\\Delta{Y} = \\Delta{Y^e}\\), we can write\n\\[\nI = \\Delta K = a_1\\Delta Y = \\Delta K_u = a_1\\Delta{Y}\n\\] Thus, \\(a_1\\) is not arbitrary, but conformed to the known quantity of capital required to expand production through investment.\nWe have thus the investment function:\n\\[\nI_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\] The saving function, on the other hand, is equal to:\n\\[\nS_t = sY_t\n\\]\nWith \\(s\\) the propensity to save. This saving function simply means that the total saving is a fixed proportion of total income (production).\nThe last steps to find the warranted rate of growth is to equate the savings and investment function, after making the assumption that expectations are realized:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_t = Y^e_t\n\\\\\nS_t = I_t\n\\\\\ns_tY = a_1(Y_t - Y_{t-1})\n\\\\\n\\frac{s}{a_1} = \\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe warranted rate of growth is thus\n\\[y_w = \\frac{s}{a_1}\\]\nTo sum up, the three rates of growth are\n\nActual Growth Rate\n\n\\(y = \\frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\\)\n\nNatural Growth Rate\n\n\\(y_n = q + n\\)\n\nWarranted Growth Rate\n\n\\(y_w = \\frac{s}{a_1}\\)\n\n\n3.1.2 The First Harrod Problem\nThe first Harrod problem states that there is no mechanisms that would ensure a persistent or non-accidental equality between the three growth rates, thus the equality\n\\[\ny = \\frac{s}{a_1} = \\bar{q} + \\bar{n}\n\\] is possible, but as the manual puts it, not likely. The reason is that what influences the warranted rate of growth and the natural rate of growth are independent of each other.\n\n\n3.1.3 The Second Harrod Problem\nThe second Harrod problem states that the warranted rate of growth \\(y_w = s/a_1\\) is unstable. That means that any deviation of the rate of growth from the warranted rate will be self-reinforcing.\nTo see this, we start with the equality between savings and investment:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nI = S\n\\\\\nI_t = sY_t\n\\\\\nY_t = \\frac{I_t}{s}\n\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThen by substituting \\(I_t\\) by the investment function \\(I_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\\):\n\\[\nY_t = \\frac{a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})}{s} = \\frac{Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}}{y_w}\n\\] Note that here \\(a_1/s\\) is the inverse of the warranted rate of growth \\(y_w\\), this is why \\(y_w\\) appears at the denominator. If we divide both sides of the equation above by the expected rate of growth \\(Y^e_t\\), we get:\n\\[\\frac{Y_t}{y^e_t} = \\frac{y^e}{y_w}\\]\n\\(y^e\\) comes from the fact that we divided \\(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}\\) by \\(Y^e_t\\), which is the rate of growth of expected growth rate. This equation above simply shows that, if expectations are realized (\\(Y_t = Y^e_t\\), this is a condition for the warranted rate of growth), and \\(y^e = y_w\\), then we have an equilibrium between the actual growth rate and warranted growth rate\n\\[y^e = y = y_w\\]\nThe second Harrod problem explains that any deviation of \\(y\\) from \\(y_w\\) will be self-reinforcing. If \\(y&lt;y_w\\), there will be a downwards pressure on \\(y\\), thus a persistent recession. Conversely, if \\(y&gt;y_w\\), there will be an upwards pressure on \\(y\\), hence a self-reinforcing economic expansion.\nThese mechanisms are the results of how the model conceive the change of the expected growth rate \\(y^e_t\\). If at period \\(t\\) the growth rate \\(y_t\\) is greater than the expected growth rate \\(y_t&gt;y^e_t\\), then at period \\(t+1\\) agents will revise their expected growth rate upward \\(y^e_{t+1} &gt; y^e_t\\). This simple behavioral principle can be summarized as:\n\\[y_t &gt; y^e_t \\Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} &gt;y^e_t\\]\n\\[y_t &lt; y^e_t \\Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} &lt;y^e_t\\]\n\n\n\nInstability of the Warranted rate of Growth\n\n\nThe graph above shows that any deviation from the equilibrium point, at which \\(y_w = y = y^e\\) will lead either to permanent boom or bust. Note that the second Harrod problem depends on how expectations are revised: here we consider expectations as adaptive: expectations will be based on what happened at the previous period.\n\n\n3.1.4 Interactions between actual, warranted and natural growth rates\nTwo scenarios can be considered.\nFirst, when \\(y_w&lt;y_N\\), the economy will be prone to boom and bust behavior. If the actual growth rate is greater than the warranted growth rate, the former will be ever-increasing until the economy will “overheat” when the actual growth rate is superior to the natural rate (which is an upper limit above which there will be exhaustion of labor force and a likely wage-inflation spiral).\nSecond, if \\(y_w&gt;y_N\\), the economy is in a situation of chronic depression. Since the actual growth rate cannot be permanently equal to the warranted rate in this situation (because of the upper limit \\(y_N\\)), the actual rate of growth would tend to permanently fall until government policies would likely start to intervene.\nFinally, this model has consequence for economic policy. Increasing the saving propensity \\(s\\) to boost growth is not a good idea if it is not accompanied by a rise in aggregate demand, in which case increased saving means reduced consumption demand and investment demand is not guaranteed to offset the fall in consumption."

The main difference is the fact that the early Kaldorian model (EKM) includes the saving propensity out of wages \\(s_w\\) whereas the classical-marxian model only includes savings out of profits.\nRecall that the classical-marxian saving function was\n\\(S/K= s_r(r-r_min)\\)\nThe EKM introduces savings out of wages, with a propensity lower than savings out of profits. Total savings is thus a weighted average bewteen savings out of wages and profits:\n\\[S = [(1-\\pi)s_w+\\pi s_r]Y\\]\n\\(\\pi\\) is the profit share, \\((1-\\pi)\\) the wage share, with \\(0&lt;s_w &lt; s_r&lt;1\\).\n\n\n3.2.2 EKM Assumptions\nThe model makes some assumptions, which are globally similar to the C-M model:\n\nEKM assumes that labor productivity is constant \\(q=0\\), hence the natural rate of growth is simply \\(y_N=n\\).\nLike the Classical-Marxian model, growth rate is the rate of capital accumulation \\(g = \\Delta K/K\\).\nFull or constant capacity rate of utilization \\(u\\)\nConstancy and exogenous capital-output and labor-output ratios \\(a_0,a_1\\)\n\nTo maintain full employment, capital accumulate rate must grow the same as the investment rate and labor supply growth rate:\n\\(g = \\frac{I}{K} = n\\)\n\n\n3.2.3 EKM Equilibrium\nAs usual, we equate \\(S = I\\), to find the equilibrium:\n\\[g = n = \\frac{I}{K} = \\frac{S}{K} = \\frac{[(1-\\pi)s_w+\\pi s_r]Y}{K} = \\frac{(s_r-s_w)\\pi + s_w}{a_1}\\]\nThe equilibrium profit share is thus\n\\[\\pi^* = \\frac{a_1 n - s_w}{s_r - s_w}\\]\nAnd the equilibrium growth rate is\n\\[g^* = n = \\frac{s^*}{a_1}\\]\nA major difference with the C-M model is that instead of considering an exogenous wage share or real wage and deriving the profit rate and growth rate from it, Kaldor set the growth rate equal to its natural rate and derive the profit/wage share and saving propensity necessary to reach this equilibrium. For the EKM to work, wage and profit shares must be flexible, there must be active government stabilization policies (fiscal & monetary).\nEKM has the implications that for the economy to grow faster only with higher inequality."

    "text": "3.3 Neo-Robinsonian Model\nThe major point of this model is to introduce a separation between investment and savings. All the models we saw until now did not distinguish between savings and investment (as the classical-marxian model).\n\n3.3.1 Separating Savings from Investment\nThe main equations of the model are thus a saving function out of profits and a desired investment as a positive function of expected profits.\n\nSaving function\n\n\\[\\sigma = s_rr\\] With \\(\\sigma\\) savings.\n\nDesired investment function\n\n\\[g = f(r^e)\\]\n\\(g\\) being investment. This function is assumed to have positive but diminishing marginal impact of expected profits on desired investment (\\(f'&gt;0, f''&lt;0\\)).\n\n\n\nRobinson “banana diagram”\n\n\nPoint A on the graph above is a stable equilibrium whereas point B is an unstable one. The graph has to be read as follows: at \\(r_0\\) the saving rate is smaller than the (desired) growth rate \\(g_0\\). At \\(g_0\\), the corresponding profit rate is \\(r_1\\), which is above the profit rate related to actual saving rate (\\(r_0\\)). Firms have thus invested in way that will make profits rise and they will thus revise their profits expectations upwards: at \\(r_1\\) they will invest at a level slighlty above \\(g_0\\), which will again push up the profit rate until point A, at which \\(g=\\sigma\\) is reached.\nOn the other hand, if we start at any profit rate below point B, the desired rate of investment will lead to a growth rate that will lead in return to a lower profit rate, firms will revise their profit rate expectations downwards and thus reduce their desired rate of investment, which will then lead to an even lower growth and profit rates and so on. Below point B, this process does not end automatically, there must be for example government stabilization. Above point A, however, the process is the same as described above in this paragraph, but it stabilizes at point A. Note that what happens below point B is strongly similar to the second Harrod problem.\n\n\n3.3.2 Connecting Neo-Robinsonian Model with Wage-Profit Relationship\nThe Neo-Robinsonian model combines the model above with the inverse wage-profit relationship we saw in the C-M model. The desired investment rate is simplified to\n\\(g = f_0+f_1r^e\\)\nWith the same saving function \\(\\sigma = s_rr\\) and the inverse profit-wage relationship \\(w =\\frac{1-a_1 r}{a_0}\\)\nTo find the equilibrium levels of growth, profit and wage rates, we set investment equals to savings \\(\\sigma = g\\) and solve for:\n\\[r^* = \\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1}\\]\nand\n\\[g^*=\\frac{s_rf_0}{s_r-f_1}\\]\nand\n\\[w^* = \\frac{1}{a_0} - \\frac{a_1}{a_0}(\\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1})\\]\nNote that in this model the real wage and wage share are flexible, but nominal wage is not.\n\n\n\nNeo-robinsonian model\n\n\nIn this model, an increase in the propensity to save leads to lower equilibrium level of growth and profit rates and a higher equilibrium real wage. The mechanism is that an increase in the propensity to save, with an unchanged desired investment curve (which means that saving propensity increases without changing firms’ willingness to invest), reduces aggregate demand through a reduction in consumption demand. With falling demand, profits realized from actual investment expenditures also fall.\n\n\n\nEffect of an increase in saving propensity\n\n\nGraphically, the saving curve rotates down to the right. Why does the real wage increase? Recall that in this model, nominal wage is fixed. A change in real wage must then come from a change in the price level. In the case of higher propensity to save, the latter has depressed aggregate demand and growth, which reduces the price level \\(\\searrow P\\).\nWhat if we consider a shift in the desired investment curve? An exemple would be a rise in \\(f_0\\), which can be interpreted as the level of confidence of firms: the higher their confidence in the economy, the higher they will invest for every level of expected profit rates. A rise in \\(f_0\\) would shift the desired investment curve \\(g = f_0+f_1r\\) to the right, profit rate would rise, growth rate would rise, but real wage would decrease. Real wage decreases because inflation increases as a result of higher aggregate demand and thus excess demand in the goods market. Note that inflation in the Neo-robinsonian model is always “demand-pushed”, that is, led by excess or lower demand in the market for goods and services."

    "text": "3.4 Marglin’s neo-Marxian/neo-Keynesian synthesis\nSince the assumption of fixed real wage was considered not very realistic, since it is very likely that workers would bargain for higher wages in the case of higher inflation as described above, Marglin has constructed model which is a mixed between the classical-marxian model and the neo-robinsonian model. Marglin’s contribution was to consider that workers bargain for nominal wages rather than the real wage or wage share.\nMarglin’s synthesis add two functions, which model the change in nominal wage and price level.\n\n3.4.1 Change in nominal wage\n\\(\\hat{W} = \\Omega (\\bar{w} - w)\\)\nWith \\(\\bar{w}\\) the target real wage for workers and \\(\\Omega\\) a constant describing how fast change in nominal wage adjusts to the difference between the target real wage and the real wage \\((\\bar{w} - w)\\). If the target real wage is greater than the actual real wage, workers are willing and are able to bargain for higher wages.\n\n\n3.4.2 Change in price\n\\(\\hat{P} = \\Phi (g^d-g)\\)\nWith\n\\(g^d = f_0 + f_1r\\) (assuming \\(r^e = r\\))\nThe desired investment function, which means that the desired investment rate (\\(g^d\\)) is a positive function of the profit rate (assumed to be equal to the expected rate).\nAnd\n\\(g = s_rr\\)\nThe saving function, which is also a positive function of profit rate.\nThus, \\(\\hat{P} = \\Phi (g^d-g)\\), means that inflation (persistent change in price level: \\(\\hat{P}\\)) is always the result of excess demand in the goods market, excess demand due to the fact that \\(g^d&gt;g\\), demand related to investment (demand for tools, machinery, equipment…).\nThis price level change equation captures an important assumption of the neo-keynesian models that inflation is always “demand-led”, that is, led by excessive demand in the goods market. Another assumption is the constancy of the capital to full capacity output ratio \\(a_1\\) (constant technology).\n\n\n3.4.3 Dynamics of the Model\nThe equilibrium condition of the model, which will determine growth, real wage and profit rate, is the equality between price change and nominal wage change:\n\\[\\widehat{W} = \\widehat{P}\\]\n\n\n\nMarglin’s Classical-Marxian - NeoRobinsonian synthesis\n\n\nAt this equilibrium, the real wage \\(W/P\\) is constant. The other variables behave as such:\n\nIf the target real wage increase \\(\\bar{w}\\), equilibrium profit rate decreases, real wage increases, growth rate decreases and equilibrium inflation increases.\nIf \\(f_0\\), firms’ confidence in the economy, increases, equilibrium inflation increases, equilibrium profit rate and growth rate also increase and equilibrium real wage decreases.\nIf the propensity \\(s_r\\) to save increases, equilibrium profit rate and inflation decrease, but the impact on growth is ambiguous: on the one hand growth is constrained by available savings (and thus if savings increase growth can increase) but on the other hand, growth can also decrease because of the fall in profit rate.\n\nAn important contribution of this model is to make explicit the argument about inflation, which was only implicit in the previous neo-keynesian models (Robinson, Kaldor…). An crucial point is that the model assumes that inflation is always driven by demand (excess demand in the goods market). A critic adressed to this model is that inflation is not only “demand-pull” but can also be “cost-push”, that is, driven positively by an increase in firms’ markups due to an increase in costs.\nAnother critic concerns that inflation caused by the difference between \\(g^d&gt;g\\) is not very realistic because it implies that firms will always want to invest at a rate they cannot achieve."

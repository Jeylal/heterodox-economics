# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website is a guide for economics, macroeconomics and especially heterodox macroeconomics. Most of the content and macro models presented here are summaries of @blecker_heterodox_2019 manual on heterodox macroeconomics. I created this website simply because I need a platform to put all my notes and summaries from my economics classes during my studies, so that I can have a quick access to it and also make it accessible to anyone interested in the topic.

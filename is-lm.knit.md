## Intro

The main objective of macroeconomics is to describe and explain the relationship between important economic variables such as unemployment, inflation, production and growth or the interest rate. Questions macroeconomics typically tries to answer are "how can long run growth be sustained?" "how can unemployment be reduced?". Macroeconomics also takes into account economic policy and the role of the government: how can the government reduce unemployment, increase output and maintain low level of inflation?

Those are all questions most of macro models try to answer. In this blog post, I will explain one of the most famous and widespread macro model, which is the **Investment-Savings - Liquidity-Money** model (IS-LM model).

## Production as Gross National Product (GDP)

The main feature of the model is a graph, which show the relationship between output and the interest rate. But first, we have to define what is actually output (production) in macro theory.

### The three approach to GDP

Production is defined as the sum of value added within an economy (can be a nation, a region, or the world taken as a whole) during a period of time (a year, month, semester, quarter...). There are three equivalent ways to define and compute GDP:

1.  **Production approach**

    GDP is equal to the value (measured in price) of all final goods and services sold minus the value of all intermediary inputs used in the production process

$GDP \equiv value\: output\: sold - cost\: intermediary\: inputs$

2.  **Income approach**

    GDP is equal to the income of all agents in the economy

$GDP \equiv salaries\:of\:workers + profits\:of\:capital\:owners$

3.  **Expenditure approach**

    Finally, and this is the most famous definition of GDP, GDP is equal to the total expenditure in the economy, which can be decomposed into the private expenditures of housholds on goods and services C, private expenditure of firms, investment I, and public expenditure G.

$GDP \equiv C + I + G$

If we take into account the fact that the economy is trading with the rest of the world, we must include the expenditure on imported goods M (imports) and expenditure from the rest of the world for national goods and services X (exports).

$GDP \equiv C + I + G + (X-I)$

Those three approaches are equivalent. Take for example the income and expenditure methods: it makes sense that any expenditure someone makes has to be a revenue for someone else.

### Investment-savings curve (IS)

The objective of the IS curve is to describe the relationship between the interest rate and output, which is determined by demand in the short run.

The first step is to model demand and the equilibrium on the goods and services market. This can be done from the expenditure method to GDP, since expenditure is kind of the same way to say demand.

The total demand in a (closed) economy is thus

$Y \equiv GDP \equiv C + I + G$

#### Consumption C

But what determines private consumption C? IS-LM model considers that consumption as a positive function of income $Y$

$C = C_{0}+C_{1}Y$

With $C_{0}$ the minimum level of consumption if income is zero, $C_{1}$ the marginal propsentity to consume (the additional consumption resulting from one-unit increase in income Y) and $Y$ the income. Note that income $Y$ is the *disposable* income, that is, income after tax T: $Y_d = Y-T$. Taxes T can be written as a proportion taken from income $T = tY$ with $t$ the tax rate on income.

The consumption function can thus be rewritten:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C = C_{0}+C_{1}Y
\\
C = C_{0} + C_{1}(Y-tY)
\\
C = C_{0} + C_{1}Y(1-t)
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Investment I

Regarding investment, the latter is considered as a decreasing function of the interest rate i:

$I = I_{0} -iI_{1}$

The logic behind a negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is the following: the interest rate is the cost of borrowing. The higher the i, the higher it is to finance investment through borrowing. Conversely, at low i borrowing is cheaper, making firms more likely to borrow in order to invest.

#### Public spending G

Government spending is considered as exogenous in the is-lm model. This means that G is determined by government decisions which is determined outside the model.

#### Final output equation

The formula $Y \equiv GDP \equiv C + I + G$ can thus take its final IS form:

$Y = [C_{0} + C_{1}Y(1-t)] + [I_{0} - iI_{1}] + \bar{G}$

We can see in this equation that ouput Y is negatively related to the interest rate i: the IS curve as thus a negative linear shape.

To grasp the function in an easier way, we will just consider that the IS curve is a linear function of consumption (positive relation between output and consumption), Investment and government spending (also positive relation) and the interest rate (negative relation):

$IS = Y = F[C(Y_{+}, T_{-}), I(i_{-}), G_{+}]$

As shown in the graph above, an increase in government spending or in consumption (but not due to an increase in income) or in investment (except due to a decline in interest rate) will induce a positive shift (upward) of the IS curve. A negative shock will make a shift downards (negative shock).

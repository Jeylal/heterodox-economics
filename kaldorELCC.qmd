# Export-led Growth


## Introduction

Kaldorian growth theory represents an important branch of heterodox macroeconomics. Within Kaldorian theory, two distinct models were developed by Kaldorians. Unlike the models seen until, with the exception of the open-economy neo-Kaleckian model, Kaldor and Kaldorians developed models of demand-driven growth based on the positive effects of export demand for growth. Furthermore, Kaldorian theory is based on a generalization of stylized facts, empirical relationships between economic variables which were found during his time. The most famous example of these stylized facts is *Verdoorn law*, which is a law based on an empirical correlation between manufacturing output and labor productivity growth. Therefore, the Kaldorian story of export-led growth can be briefly and roughly summarized as such:

- Aggregate demand is what drives economic growth whether it be in the short or long run. Demand for exports (demand by other countries/regions for domestic products) is a crucial source for aggregate demand. Additionally, there is a positive interactive relationship between manufacturing output growth and labor productivity growth. The latter has also, ceteris paribus, a positive effect on exports since higher productivity reduces the price of exported goods and thus increases international competitiveness of domestic goods. Labor productivity, exports and manufacturing output growth have thus positive cumulative interactions leading to sustain growth process. For instance, an increase in labor productivity will increase exports, which will increase manufacturing output, which will in return increase labor productivity, increase exports even further and a virtuous and cumulative cycle of growth is launched. Note that the impetus of this growth mechanism can be launched by any of the three factors (rise in productivity, manufacturing output or exports after a currency depreciation).

This short but essential Kaldorian story of export-led cumulative causation growth (ELCC) is based on the following laws

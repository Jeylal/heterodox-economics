This website is a guide for economics, macroeconomics and especially
heterodox macroeconomics. Most of the content and macro models presented
here are summaries of Blecker and Setterfield (2019) manual on heterodox
macroeconomics. I created this website simply because I need a platform
to put all my notes and summaries from my economics classes during my
studies, so that I can have a quick access to it and also make it
accessible to anyone interested in the topic.

\hypertarget{introduction-market-equilibrium}{%
\chapter{Introduction: Market
Equilibrium}\label{introduction-market-equilibrium}}

This website is guide to mainstream and heterodox economics constructed
from my personal notes from a variety of bachelor and master level
economics courses. goal is to provide summaries of important topics in
neoclassical and heterodox economics. Since having some background in
mainstream economics is crucial to understand the heterodox and
Post-Keynesian economics, mainly because the latter are constructed
partly as a response and critic of mainstream-neoclassical economics,
the present introduction will summarize the basics of neoclassical
production theory, consumer theory and market equilibrium.

Let's first recall what market equilibrium is, because it is one of the
most important concept in economics.

\hypertarget{market-equilibrium}{%
\section{Market equilibrium}\label{market-equilibrium}}

\hypertarget{what-is-a-market}{%
\subsection{What is a market?}\label{what-is-a-market}}

Market equilibrium is perhaps the most important element of neoclassical
theory. Every introductory mainstream textbooks start with market
equilibrium. Acemoglu, Laibson, and List (2017) defines a market as:

``A group of economic agents who are trading a good or service plus the
rules and arrangements for trading'' (Acemoglu, Laibson, and List 2017,
59).

The definition given by Pindyck and Rubinfeld (2013) is more precise:

``\textbf{Market}: Collection of buyers and sellers that, through their
actual or potential interactions, determine the price of a product or
set of products'' (Pindyck and Rubinfeld 2013, 8).

Stated simply, market equilibrium tells what will be the price of any
object or service, as long as the latter are turned into commodities.
Market equilibrium explains not only the equilibrium level of prices and
commodities of any good or service, but also the change in prices
resulting from exogenous shocks (change in income, confidence,
technology\ldots).

A market is thus a place (material or not) where an object or service
turned into a commodity is offered by suppliers and demanded by
consumers and thus traded when an agreement is reached over the price
which will determine the value of the traded commodity.

\hypertarget{markets-under-perfect-competition}{%
\subsection{Markets under perfect
competition}\label{markets-under-perfect-competition}}

But there are many types of markets. Microeconomics generally starts
with an ideal-type market: the \emph{perfectly competitive market}. The
latter refers to any market in which there are a large number of
suppliers as well as large number of consumers. An important
characteristic of perfectly competitive markets is that \emph{suppliers
and consumers think that they cannot manipulate or have an influence
over the market price}. Market price is thus considered as \emph{given}
and \emph{fixed} by the market when demand equates supply, as we will
see below.

\hypertarget{demand-supply-equilibrium}{%
\subsection{Demand, Supply,
Equilibrium}\label{demand-supply-equilibrium}}

Consumers' total demand for a commodity constitutes the overall market
demand for that commodity. Demand is considered to be negatively related
to the price of that commodity: the higher the price, the lower the
demand. On the other hand, firms' supply of the commodity is a positive
function of price. The higher the price, the higher the profits for any
level of production, hence higher incentive to increase production and
supply more quantity.

Let's now take an example: suppose that the demand for grain follows a
negative linear function.

\(Q_{demand} = 7-0.5p\)

That means that the quantity demanded for grains decreases if the price
for grain increases and vice and versa. The slope of the demand curve,
\(-0.5\), means that when the price increases by one, the quantity
demanded decreases by 0.5.

Moreover, let's say that the quantity supplied for grains is a positive
linear function of prices for grain: the higher the price, the more are
firms willing to supply grains.

\(Q_{supply} = 1+0.6p\)

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{demand }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(p) }\DecValTok{7} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\NormalTok{ (}\FloatTok{0.5}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{p)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{intro_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

To find the equilibrium price and quantity, we equate the demand and
supply functions and solve for q:

\[
q_{demand} = 7- 0.5*p
\] \[
q_{supply} = 1 + 0.6*p 
\]

\[
q_{demand} = q_{supply}
\]

\[
7 - 0.5*p = 1 + 0.6*p
\]

\[
6-0.11p = 0
\]

\[
p^* = 6/1.1 = 5.45
\]

The equilibrium price level is thus \(p^* = 5.45\). To find the
equilibrium quantity, we simple put the value of the equilibrium price
(5.45) into either the supply or demand function:
\(7-0.5*5.45 = 4.275 = p^*\)

It is easy to check directly if the computation is correct in r:

\includegraphics{intro_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

At equilibrium, economists say that ``the market clears''. In other
words, when equilibrium is reached all commodities are sold, every
suppliers have sold their commodities and every consumers have purchased
one.

\hypertarget{deviations-from-market-price}{%
\subsection{Deviations from market
price}\label{deviations-from-market-price}}

If the price was lower than the market price, for instance after a price
control policy (think for example of all the debates about energy price
since covid and the war), there would be excess demand. Every commodity
would be sold, but there would still be consumers who want to consume
the good, but cannot because suppliers do not want to increase
production because the price is too low.

Conversely, if the price was above the market price, there would be a
situation of excess supply. Firms supply a large quantity of commodities
since the price is relatively very high, but not all commodities would
be sold because some consumers would think that the price is too high
for them.

\hypertarget{change-in-equilibrium-prices}{%
\subsection{Change in equilibrium
prices}\label{change-in-equilibrium-prices}}

Finally, change in market price happens each time either the supply
curve or the demand curve shift to the right (positive shock) or to the
left (negative shock).

Regarding demand curve shifts, (Acemoglu, Laibson, and List 2017, 67)
give five factors:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Tastes and preferences
\item
  Income and wealth
\item
  Availability and prices of related goods
\item
  Number and scale of buyers
\item
  Buyers' beliefs about the future
\end{enumerate}

And four factors for shifts in supply curve (Acemoglu, Laibson, and List
2017, 73):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Prices of inputs used to produce the good
\item
  Technology used to produce the good
\item
  Number and scale of sellers
\item
  Sellers' beliefs about the future
\end{enumerate}

But how did neoclassical theory arrive to this kind of model of
equilibrium price and quantity determination? To understand better this
model, we need to know why we have this positive supply curve and this
negative demand curve. We will first investigate consumer choice theory,
which is behind the negative demand curve, and then production theory,
which is behind the positive supply curve.

\hypertarget{neoclassical-mainstream-consumer-choice-theory}{%
\chapter{Neoclassical-mainstream consumer choice
theory}\label{neoclassical-mainstream-consumer-choice-theory}}

Mainstream consumer choice theory has for ambition to explain consumers'
decision, that is to say, the choices consumers make between consuming
one good or another.

\hypertarget{the-three-assumptions}{%
\section{The three assumptions}\label{the-three-assumptions}}

Consumer theory makes important assumptions, which are the foundation of
the theory:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Completeness}:

  consumers have complete knowledge about the goods and services they
  can potentially consume, they have clear preferences about these goods
  and services and can rank all of them (like a descending list where we
  would have the most preferred goods and services at the top and
  utility associated with goods and services would decrease as we go
  down in the list)
\item
  \textbf{Transitivity}:

  Preferences regarding goods and services are transitive. That means
  that if a consumer prefers A to B and B to C, A is better than C.
\item
  \textbf{More is better than less}

  (non satiety assumption): Goods and services are always desirable. For
  example, if someone gives you one apple, then two, then three, then
  twenty, and then one thousands, you would always accept those apples,
  because you are still better off even if one gives you too many
  apples.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{utility-function-marginal-utility}{%
\section{Utility function, marginal
utility}\label{utility-function-marginal-utility}}

Consumer theory then illustrates any choice between two goods with the
help of the famous indifference curves , which show the relation between
the demand for one good against the demand for another good (for example
food and clothes, cars and bikes\ldots). Indifference curves are based
on \textbf{utility functions} whose really important property and
assumption is the decreasing marginal utility principle. Decreasing
marginal utility means that for every one additional unit of a given
good a consumer get, the utility for this consumer increases less than
the previous additional unit. Let's say, for instance, that you don't
have food at the moment and you are hungry: if i give you one apple, you
will be a lot better off and your utility will increase a lot when I
give you this one apple. Then, if I give you another apple, your utility
will still increase, but by less than when I gave you the first apple.
Finally, after I give you an additional apple for the fifteenth time,
your additional utility will still be positive, but by far more less
than when I gave you the first apple.

\includegraphics{consumer-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

Decreasing marginal utility is an important assumption which explains
the shape of the indifference curves. The latter, if the two goods are
substitutes (but not perfect substitute) and not perfect complements,
are convex-shaped. If, for instance, we consider an indifference curve
for the choice between units of apples and bikes, the line of the
indifference curve represents all the possible combination of the two
goods which give the same utility for the consumer.

\hypertarget{indifference-curve}{%
\subsection{Indifference curve}\label{indifference-curve}}

Indifference curves are based on utility functions. An utility function
can be for example:

\[
\begin{aligned}
U(x,y)=x^20.18y
\end{aligned}
\] With x and y two different goods, apples and watches for example. To
get the indifference curve function, we fix utility U at any positive
value, and rearrange the function above to get y as a function of x and
U:

\[
\begin{aligned}
U = x^20.18y
\\
y = \frac{U}{0.18*x^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{verbatim}
Yacas vector:
[1] y == U/(0.18 * x^2)
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics{consumer-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{budget-constraint}{%
\section{Budget constraint}\label{budget-constraint}}

In the indifference curve graph above, the consumer can choose any
combination of apples and watches on the line, and those combinations
would bring the same utility U = 10. However, one important element was
not taken into account yet. This element is the fact that consumers are
limited in their consumption decisions by their income. Neoclassical
theory calls this \textbf{budget constraint}. For instance, let's say
that our consumer has an income of 600 francs. The price of one apple is
4 francs (one bag of apples to be more realistic) whereas the price of a
watch is 200 francs. The budget constraint can be written as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
Income = P_{apple}*Q_{apple} + P_{watch}*Q_{watch}
\\
600 = 4*apple + 200*watch
\end{aligned}
\]

To include this budget constraint into the previous graph, we have to
rearrange this equation to have the quantity of apples as a function of
the quantity of books:

\$\$

\begin{aligned}
600 = 4*apple + 200*watch
\\
4apple = 600 - 200watch
\\
apple = 600/4 - 200/4*watch
\\
apple = 150 - 50*watch

\end{aligned}

\$\$ More generally, the budget function can also be written as

\[
Q_1 = \frac{Income}{P_1} - \frac{P_2}{P_1}Q_2
\]

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{budget }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(x) }\DecValTok{150} \SpecialCharTok{{-}} \DecValTok{50}\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we can plot both the indifference curves and the budget constraint:

\includegraphics{consumer-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

The budget line represents all the combination of apples and watches
that the consumer can afford with his income. This implies that is final
choice has to be on this line. The consumer cannot afford to be on the U
= 90 indifference curve because its income is not large enough. Also, he
will not choose any point on U = 10 because the latter's majority of
point are on the left of the budget line (the assumption of more is
better than less would not be respected if the consumer for instance
chooses 1 watch and 50 apples, because he can afford more of the two
goods).

So what will be the consumer's final choice? He will choose the point at
which the budget constraint line is tangent to one of his indifference
curve.

Mathematically, this means that the quantity of apples and watches the
consumer will choose is the point at which the slope of the budget line
\(\frac{P_{watch}}{P_{apples}}\) is equal to the slope of the
indifference curve, which microeconomics call the \textbf{marginal rate
of substitution}. Marginal rate of substitution shows how much of a good
(here apples) the consumer can give up in exchange of one unit of the
other good (here a watch). Using algebra, we can find the slope of the
budget line and of the indifference curve by computing their
derivatives.

\[
\begin{aligned}
apple = 150 - 50*watch
\\
\frac{\partial{apple}}{\partial{watch}} = -50
\\
\end{aligned}
\]

Note that finding the marginal rate of substitution is a bit trickier
than for the budget line. To find the MRS, we have to compute the
derivative with respect to the first good (x which are apples here) and
then for the second one (y the watches). Then, the MRS is the ratio
between the two marginal utilities
\(\frac{\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{x}}}{\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{y}}}\)

\[
\begin{aligned}
U = x^20.18y
\\
\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{x}} = 0.36xy
\\
\frac{\partial{U}}{\partial{y}} = 0.18*x^2 
\end{aligned}
\] Thus

\[
\begin{aligned}
MRS = \frac{0.36xy}{0.18x^2} = 2\frac{y}{x}
\end{aligned}
\] Here is how to compute this in R

Then, we set the marginal rate of substitution equal to the slope of the
budget line:

\[
\begin{aligned}
2\frac{y}{x} = 50
\\
y = 25x
\end{aligned}
\] We can then substitute y with 25x in the budget equation

\$\$

\begin{aligned}
y = 150 - 50*x
\\
25x = 150 -50x
\\ 
x = 150/75 = 2
\\
x = 2

\end{aligned}

\$\$

The optimal solution for x (quantity of watch) is thus 2, the consumer
will choose 2 watches. Now that know the quantity of watches, we can
obtain the quantity of apples as well as how much utility this
combination of apples and watches will bring to the consumer.

To get the number of apples, we simply replace x by 6 in the budget
constraint equation \(y = 150-50*2 = 50\), \(U = 2^2*50*0.18 = 36\)

R can check the results

\section{Deriving the downward slopping demand curve from indifference
curve and budget
constrain}\label{deriving-the-downward-slopping-demand-curve-from-indifference-curve-and-budget-constrain}}

The final step to grasp why micro theory draws downwards slopping demand
curve is to see how a change in relative prices \(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\)
changes the consumer's optimal choice for a good (the equilibrium point
in the last graph). In our example, the optimal quantity choice of watch
for the consumer was 2 (2 watches costing 200 francs each). What
happends in the graph above if the price of watch increases?

The budget constraint will change. Initially we have

\(apple = 150 - 50watch\)

And now, the price of watch increases up to 400, income is unchanged
(Income = 600) as well as the price of apples (4):

\[
\begin{aligned}
600 = 4*apple + 400watch
\\
4apple = 600-400watch
\\
apple = 150 - 100watch
\end{aligned}
\]

\includegraphics{consumer-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf}

At the new equilibrium level, utility has decreased to 9, apple
consumption remains unchanged and the quantity of watches has decreased
to one. Note that there are two important mechanisms behind the graph
above:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Income effect} Income effect relates to how the demand for a
  good change when income changes. If the demand increases when income
  increases, micro talks about \emph{positive income effect} (and
  conversely negative income effect). In our example, the consumer's
  income has not changed (600 francs), but the real income has
  decreased, because the price of one the good has increased. The
  consumer has thus a lower (real) income, which led to a decrease in
  the quantity demanded for the good whose price increased.
\item
  \textbf{Substitution effect} Substitution effect refers to how the
  demand for a good change when the relative price of the good changes.
\end{enumerate}

Income and substitution effects depend on the type of the good. There
are indeed different types of goods, depending on how demand changes
when price changes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Normal good}

  A good is normal when demand increases when its price decreases vice
  and versa
\item
  \textbf{Inferior good}

  A good is inferior when the demand decreases as income increases or
  the price increases
\item
  \textbf{Giffen good}

  A Giffen good refers to goods whose demand increases when price
  increases. The logic behind this are the goods which are very
  essential to every day living (for example staple food): an increase
  in the price of very essential food can lead to the consumer's
  decision of reducing the consumption of other goods to still afford
  consuming the essential good.
\end{enumerate}

This is how microeconomics derive the demand curve. We will see below
that the supply curve is also derived with the same logic, the steps
being almost the same as we saw here, but by replacing the utility
function with a production function and replacing the two goods by
capital and labour, which are the factors of production of any firm.

As I explained in the
\href{https://jeylal.github.io/myblog/economics_series/consumer\%20theory/consumer\%20theory.html}{consumer
theory post}, the most important element of mainstream neoclassical
theory is the concept of market equilibrium under perfect competition.
In the consumer theory post, I explained how mainstream economists
derive the market equilibrium downwards slopping demand curve. Here, the
objective is to understand how the other curve, the upward slopping
supply curve, is derived. To understand why mainstream economics arrived
to this result, one needs to understand mainstream production theory,
which is the goal of this post.

\hypertarget{how-firms-produce-in-neoclassical-mainstream-theory}{%
\section{How firms produce in neoclassical-mainstream
theory}\label{how-firms-produce-in-neoclassical-mainstream-theory}}

Neoclassical production theory has a very specific way to conceive
production. In fact, the theory considers that production, how firms or
productive units transform inputs (of labour, raw materials or other
intermediary inputs/materials/services) into output (final goods or
services produced), can be modeled as what is now famously known as the
\textbf{neoclassical production function}. The latter is written as:

\(Y = F(K,L)\)

With Y the output, the quantity produced, K the quantity of capital used
and L the quantity of labour employed. From now on, we will work with
the following neoclassical production function as an example:

\(Y = K^{1/2}L^{1/2}\)

Here is how to write this function in R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{neo\_prod\_fun }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \ControlFlowTok{function}\NormalTok{(l, k) (l}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{*}\NormalTok{ (k}\SpecialCharTok{\^{}}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\SpecialCharTok{/}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The neoclassical production function rests on important assumptions
which illustrate how neoclassical theory conceive the production
process:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Constant returns to scale}

  Constant returns to scale means that quantities produced increase
  proportionally with the quantity of inputs. For instance, if the
  quantities of inputs (capital and labour) are doubled, output will
  double.
\item
  \textbf{Positive but diminishing marginal returns}

  Also called diminishing marginal products, or decreasing marginal
  productivity. This means that all factors of production (capital and
  labor) show positive but diminishing marginal returns: when we
  increase one of the inputs by one, with all the other inputs fixed,
  output will increase, but by less than the previous additional input.
  For example, the quantity of capital is often considered fixed in the
  short run, making labor the only variable input in the short run.
  Labor is assumed to have a decreasing marginal productivity (or
  marginal returns): with capital fixed, each time a firm employs an
  additional laborer, output will increase, but by less than when the
  previous additional laborer was employed. In our example, marginal
  product of labour is the first derivative with respect to labour:
\end{enumerate}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial{Y}}{\partial{L}} = 0.5K^{0.5}L^{0.5-1}
\\
= 0.5K^{0.5}L^{-0.5}
\end{aligned}
\] Here is how to find the marginal productivity of labor function of
our example in R:

\NormalTok{MPL}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
function (l, k) 
0.5 * (sqrt(k)/sqrt(l))
\end{verbatim}

If we fix the amount of capital to any value, 10 and 25 for instance, we
can plot the marginal productivity of labour to better illustrate the
principle of diminishing marginal returns:

\includegraphics{production-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-6-1.pdf}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Substitutability of factors/inputs}

  This third assumption implies that there is an infinite choice bewteen
  capital and labour for each level of output. For example, to produce
  20 units of output, firms have an infinite choice to combine labour
  and capital. This is a strong assumption and as we will see the
  ``rival'' of the neoclassical production function is the Leontief
  production function, which is also called the ``fixed-proportion''
  production function, because it assumes that for each level of output,
  there is only one possible combination of capital and labour.
\end{enumerate}

Note that in the standard neoclassical production model makes the
assumption that firm operate under perfect competition: perfect
competition has three important characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Price taking}

  Since there are a lot of consumers and firms in the market, firms have
  not impact on the price, they cannot manipulate the latter. Price is
  thus exogenous and given.
\item
  \textbf{Product homogeneity}

  The good produced in the market by the firms is the same, it is
  homogenous.
\item
  \textbf{Free entry and exit}

  There are no special costs associated with the entry in the market for
  any potential firm nor costs associated with exit (a firm that would
  want to exit the market).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{short-run-and-long-run}{%
\section{Short run and long run}\label{short-run-and-long-run}}

Neoclassical production theory makes an important distinction between
the short run and the long run, with direct implication on how to
manipulate the production function:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Short run

  We talk about short run when not all factors of production can be
  changed. Capital is typically considered as a fixed factor in the
  short run, whereas labour can still be changed. Thus, in the short
  run, capital is fixed and labour is variable.
\item
  Long run

  We talk about long run when all factors can be changed. This is the
  amount of time needed to make all inputs variable.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{optimal-choice-of-output-capital-and-labour}{%
\section{Optimal choice of output, capital and
labour}\label{optimal-choice-of-output-capital-and-labour}}

In neoclassical production theory, there is an optimal choice of output,
capital and labour, which implies that there is an ideal size for a
firm. This is a strong assessment, because this implies that each firm
has an optimal size at which they grow and then stop growing once they
reach this optimal size.

\hypertarget{isoquant-and-isocost}{%
\section{Isoquant and Isocost}\label{isoquant-and-isocost}}

Isoquants are a way to represent graphically any combination of labour
and capital for any level of ouput. Capital is typically plotted on the
y axis and labour on the x axis and output is fixed along each curve. If
we go back to our production function curve \(Y = k^{0.5}L^{0.5}\), we
have to isolate k to draw isoquants for this function, and then choose
any value of output (Y):

\(K = \frac{Y^{2}}{L}\)

\includegraphics{production-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

As in consumer theory, firms cannot choose any combination of capital
and labour they want because, as consumers face a budget constraint,
firms also face a constraint: their total cost. The isocost line, which
shows all possible combinations of labour and capital that the firm can
purchase with its current budget, hence total cost. Isocost is for the
firm what the budget constraint line is to consumers.

The isocost function can be written as:

\(TC = wl +rK\)

With TC the total cost being equal to the wage (rate) w times labour L
and r the rental cost of capital K. r includes the depreciation cost of
capital and the lost interest rate (if the capital was invested
somewhere else).

Isocost can then be rearranged to:

\(K = TC/r - (w/r)/L\)

For example, let's say that the total cost over rental cost of capital
(TC/r) is equal to 40 and the wage rate - rental rate is equal to 2 (w/r
= 2). The function becomes \(K = 10 - 2L\)

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{production-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf}

The steps to derive the optimal choice of output, capital and labor is
the same than for consumer theory: here the slope of the isoquant is
called the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS). Setting the
latter equal to the slope of the isocost, which is w/r (1 in our
example) and solving for K, Y and L. In our example, the equilibrium
level of output is 14.14, with K = 20 and L = 10.

\includegraphics{production-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{profit-equation-and-profit-maximisation}{%
\section{Profit equation and profit
maximisation}\label{profit-equation-and-profit-maximisation}}

The neoclassical production function we saw above is not only important
because it models how neoclassical firms produce, but also because it is
part of the profit equation that firms want to maximize (in neoclassical
theory, firms maximize their profits as consumers maximize their
utility). The profit equation is written as:

\(\pi = PQ - TC\)

or more generally

\(\pi(q) = R(q) - TC(q)\)

With \(\pi\) the profits of the firm, \(PQ\) the price P multiplied by
the quantity produced Q, minus the total cost TC. We saw above that
total cost was equal to \(TC = wL -rK\), but micro manuals sometimes
simplify this by just stating that total cost is equal to variable cost
and fixed cost (in the short run, because in the long run all factors
are variable).

Two important concepts are linked to this profit equation: marginal
revenue and marginal cost.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Marginal revenue} is the change in revenue resulting from from
  a one-unit increase in output.
\item
  \textbf{Marginal cost} is the change in cost associated with a
  one-unit increase in output
\end{itemize}

In perfect competition, marginal revenue is determined outside the firm,
the latter having no influence on it because it has no power to
manipulate the price. Marginal revenue is in fact the market price of
the good produced by the firm and it is exogenous in a perfectly
competitive market. On the other hand, marginal cost is inherent to the
firm because it depends on the level of output chosen by the firm.

Mathematically, marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue
of the firm \(P*Q\) and is equal to the market price \(P\). Marginal
cost is the derivative of total cost, but marginal cost is not the same
whether we are in the short of the long run. In the short run, only
labour is variable, so the marginal cost is the additional increase in
cost associated with a one-unit labour increase (an additional labourer)

\(MC = \frac{\Delta{VC}}{\Delta{}{}Q} = \frac{w\Delta{}{}L}{\Delta{Q}}\)

But in the long run, marginal cost is the additional cost resulting from
an additional increase of any input
\(MC = \frac{\Delta{TC}}{\Delta{Q}}\). Algebraically, marginal cost is
the derivative of total cost (long run) or variable cost (short run).

Then, neoclassical production theory explains that the profit equation
\(\pi = PQ - TC\) has a concave form. The logic behind this is the fact
that the theory considers that firms have increasing economies of scale
at low level of production and, as output increases, economies of scale
will gradually decrease and become negative (economies of scale at the
beginning and the diseconomies of scale at some point).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Economies of scales}

  When output can be increased for less than proportionnaly increasing
  the cost. For instance if output is doubled, cost less than double.
  Neoclassical theory typically considers that for low level of output
  (small firms), economies of scale are more likely because of
  productivity gains due to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    specialization,
  \item
    reorganization of the production process and
  \item
    bargaining power for some intermediary inputs (advantage of buying
    in bulk).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Diseconomies of scales}

  When output is increased, cost more than proportionnaly increase. For
  instance, if output is doubled, cost more than double. Neoclassical
  theory considers that diseconomies of scale arrive at some point for
  high level of ouput because of:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lack of space in the factory/working place ==\textgreater{} more
    difficult to do the job
  \item
    Increasing number of tasks ==\textgreater{} management becomes more
    difficult due to increasing complexity of tasks
  \item
    The advantage of buying in bulk disappears when certain quantity
    level is reached.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Those factors explain why the profit equation is concave. This has
strong implications, because that means there is an optimal size for the
firm associated with an optimal level of output which maximise profits.

Then, we can show that profit maximization under all of those conditions
lead to the marginal cost being equal to marginal revenue

\((\pi)' = 0\) (()' meaning derivative)

\(0 =(PQ)' - (TC)'\) the derivative of total revenue is the marginal
revenue, and the derivative of the total cost is the marginal cost

\(0 =MR - MC\)

\(MR = MC\)

Graphically, the profit equation has a negative-concave shape, and
optimal level of output is set where profits are at their maximum:

\includegraphics{production-theory_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{deriving-the-supply-curve}{%
\section{Deriving the supply curve}\label{deriving-the-supply-curve}}

When will firms decide to supply a good at a given price? And why the
quantities supplied increase with the price of the good?

Micro theory tells that the supply curve represents all the combinations
of price and output (quantity of the good supplied) in which the price
is higher than the average variable cost. If the market price is below
the average variable cost (AVC), supplying the good would not be
profitable. If the price is higher than AVC, it is profitable for the
firm to produce (and the firm will supply the quantity at which its
marginal revenue, the price, is equal to the marginal cost). Then, if
price increases, marginal revenue increases, and firms can increase
production and quantity supplied until marginal revenue is again equal
to the marginal cost.

\hypertarget{is-lm-model}{%

\hypertarget{intro-1}{%
\section{Intro}\label{intro-1}}

The main objective of macroeconomics is to describe and explain the
relationship between important economic variables such as unemployment,
inflation, production and growth or the interest rate. Questions
macroeconomics typically tries to answer are ``how can long run growth
be sustained?'' ``how can unemployment be reduced?''. Macroeconomics
also takes into account economic policy and the role of the government:
how can the government reduce unemployment, increase output and maintain
low level of inflation?

Those are all questions most of macro models try to answer. In this blog
post, I will explain one of the most famous and widespread macro model,
which is the \textbf{Investment-Savings - Liquidity-Money} model (IS-LM
model).

\hypertarget{production-as-gross-national-product-gdp}{%
\section{Production as Gross National Product
(GDP)}\label{production-as-gross-national-product-gdp}}

The main feature of the model is a graph, which show the relationship
between output and the interest rate. But first, we have to define what
is actually output (production) in macro theory.

\hypertarget{the-three-approach-to-gdp}{%
\subsection{The three approach to GDP}\label{the-three-approach-to-gdp}}

Production is defined as the sum of value added within an economy (can
be a nation, a region, or the world taken as a whole) during a period of
time (a year, month, semester, quarter\ldots). There are three
equivalent ways to define and compute GDP:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Production approach}

  GDP is equal to the value (measured in price) of all final goods and
  services sold minus the value of all intermediary inputs used in the
  production process
\end{enumerate}

\(GDP \equiv value\: output\: sold - cost\: intermediary\: inputs\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Income approach}

  GDP is equal to the income of all agents in the economy
\end{enumerate}

\(GDP \equiv salaries\:of\:workers + profits\:of\:capital\:owners\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Expenditure approach}

  Finally, and this is the most famous definition of GDP, GDP is equal
  to the total expenditure in the economy, which can be decomposed into
  the private expenditures of housholds on goods and services C, private
  expenditure of firms, investment I, and public expenditure G.
\end{enumerate}

\(GDP \equiv C + I + G\)

If we take into account the fact that the economy is trading with the
rest of the world, we must include the expenditure on imported goods M
(imports) and expenditure from the rest of the world for national goods
and services X (exports).

\(GDP \equiv C + I + G + (X-I)\)

Those three approaches are equivalent. Take for example the income and
expenditure methods: it makes sense that any expenditure someone makes
has to be a revenue for someone else.

\hypertarget{investment-savings-curve-is}{%
\subsection{Investment-savings curve
(IS)}\label{investment-savings-curve-is}}

The objective of the IS curve is to describe the relationship between
the interest rate and output, which is determined by demand in the short
run.

The first step is to model demand and the equilibrium on the goods and
services market. This can be done from the expenditure method to GDP,
since expenditure is kind of the same way to say demand.

The total demand in a (closed) economy is thus

\(Y \equiv GDP \equiv C + I + G\)

\hypertarget{consumption-c}{%
\subsubsection{Consumption C}\label{consumption-c}}

But what determines private consumption C? IS-LM model considers that
consumption as a positive function of income \(Y\)

\(C = C_{0}+C_{1}Y\)

With \(C_{0}\) the minimum level of consumption if income is zero,
\(C_{1}\) the marginal propsentity to consume (the additional
consumption resulting from one-unit increase in income Y) and \(Y\) the
income. Note that income \(Y\) is the \emph{disposable} income, that is,
income after tax T: \(Y_d = Y-T\). Taxes T can be written as a
proportion taken from income \(T = tY\) with \(t\) the tax rate on
income.

The consumption function can thus be rewritten:

\[
\begin{aligned}
C = C_{0}+C_{1}Y
\\
C = C_{0} + C_{1}(Y-tY)
\\
C = C_{0} + C_{1}Y(1-t)
\end{aligned}
\]

\hypertarget{investment-i}{%
\subsubsection{Investment I}\label{investment-i}}

Regarding investment, the latter is considered as a decreasing function
of the interest rate i:

\(I = I_{0} -iI_{1}\)

The logic behind a negative relationship between investment and the
interest rate is the following: the interest rate is the cost of
borrowing. The higher the i, the higher it is to finance investment
through borrowing. Conversely, at low i borrowing is cheaper, making
firms more likely to borrow in order to invest.

\hypertarget{public-spending-g}{%
\subsubsection{Public spending G}\label{public-spending-g}}

Government spending is considered as exogenous in the is-lm model. This
means that G is determined by government decisions which is determined
outside the model.

\hypertarget{final-output-equation}{%
\subsubsection{Final output equation}\label{final-output-equation}}

The formula \(Y \equiv GDP \equiv C + I + G\) can thus take its final IS
form:

\(Y = [C_{0} + C_{1}Y(1-t)] + [I_{0} - iI_{1}] + \bar{G}\)

We can see in this equation that ouput Y is negatively related to the
interest rate i: the IS curve as thus a negative linear shape.

To grasp the function in an easier way, we will just consider that the
IS curve is a linear function of consumption (positive relation between
output and consumption), Investment and government spending (also
positive relation) and the interest rate (negative relation):

\(IS = Y = F[C(Y_{+}, T_{-}), I(i_{-}), G_{+}]\)

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{is-lm_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

As shown in the graph above, an increase in government spending or in
consumption (but not due to an increase in income) or in investment
(except due to a decline in interest rate) will induce a positive shift
(upward) of the IS curve. A negative shock will make a shift downards
(negative shock).

\part{Classical-Marxian Models}

\hypertarget{classical-marxian-models-1}{%
\chapter{Classical-Marxian Models}\label{classical-marxian-models-1}}

What follows is extensively based on the second chapter of
\emph{Heterodox Macroeconomics: Models of of Demand, Distribution and
Growth} (2019) by Robert A. Blecker and Mark Setterfield

\hypertarget{assumptions-of-the-model}{%
\subsection{Assumptions of the model}\label{assumptions-of-the-model}}

The classical-marxian model, named after Smith, Ricardo (who are
considered as classics) and marx and based on their important work,
comes its specific assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Constant or full capacity rate of utilization}.
\end{enumerate}

The latter, \(u = \frac{Y}{Y_{K}}\), is ratio of the actual output (GDP)
divided by the full capacity output \(Y_K\), which is the level if
output if all capital in the economy was used at its full capacity (no
unused machines, raw materials\ldots). If this ratio is equal to one,
that means that the economy is at full capacity, the actual output is
equal to its capacity level. If the ratio is for example 0.5, that means
that actual output is half its level if all capital was fully used. But
why does this model make such an assumption? This assumption stands in
sharp contrast with the (neo)kaleckian model which typically reverses
this assumption stating that capacity rate \(u\) is an important
adjusting variable.

Before explaining the reason behind this assumption, it is necessary to
understand the classical-marxian conception of the production process
(how inputs, capital and labor, are combined to produce either goods or
services), which rests on the \textbf{Leontieff production function}.
The latter can be written as

\[
Y = min(\frac{N}{a_0}, \frac{K}{a_1})
\]

With N and K respectively labor and capital, \(a_0 = L/Y\) the
labour-output ratio (the quantity of labour required to produce one unit
of ouput) and \(a_1 = K/Y\) the quantity of capital required to produce
one unit of output (capital-output ratio).

\(\frac{N}{a_0}\) is the maximum output that can be produced with
available labour resources while \(\frac{K}{a_1}\) represents maximum
output when all capital resources are used.

For instance, if three units of labor are required to produce one unit
of output and one unit of capital is required to produce one unit of
output, what will be produced if we have N = 9 and K = 4 ?

In our example, \(a_0 = 3/1\) (three units of labor required to produce
Y = 1) and \(a_1 = 1\) (one unit of capital to produce one unit). We
compute \(N/a_0 = 9/3\) and \(K/a_1 = 4/1\). Since the former
\(9/3 = 3\) is bigger than \(4\), all 9 units of labor will be used to
produce 3 units of output. Note that at Y = 3, one unit of capital will
be leftover and be unused. In this example, output is
``labor-constrained'' because it is the amount of labor which is fully
used and capital which is not. Output at full employment is
\(Y_N = N/a_0\).

Considering labor as the constraint is what the (neo)kaleckian model
does, while the classical-marxian model considers that capital is the
binding constraint on potential output. In the classical-marxian model,
all capital is used and thus output is output at full capital
utilization \(Y_K = K/a_1\).

While both classical-marxian and (neo)kaleckian models use Leontief
production function (and are here different from neoclassical models
which use cobb-douglas production function), they differ by what they
consider as the constraining factor on output: labor for (neo)kaleckian
model \(Y_N\), capital for classical-marxian model \(Y_k\).

Thus, considering that capital is the constraint implies the possibility
to consider that the economy can reach a full capacity utilization
\(u = Y/Y_k\), this is what the classical-marxian model does thus why
\(u\) is considered constant at full capacity \(u = 1\).

\hypertarget{wage-profit-trade-off}{%
\subsubsection{Wage-profit trade-off}\label{wage-profit-trade-off}}

The main equation is derived from the income approach to national
income, which is an accounting identity showing that national income is
the sum of all income sources in the economy. The model makes here other
assumptions: no government, closed economy, only workers and
capitalists, only one good produced, which are nessecary to write:

\[
PY = WL + rPK
\] Which is the national income identity after those assumptions, with
\(P\) the price, \(Y\) the output, \(W\) the nominal wage rate, \(L\)
the amount of labor employed, \(r\) the profit rate and \(K\) the real
stock of capital.

From this equation above is derived one the main equation of the model,
the inverse wage-profit relationship:

\[
w = \frac{1}{a_0}-\frac{a_1}{a_0}r
\]

\end{figure}

This equation also implies an inverse relationship between consumption
and growth

\[
c = \frac{1}{a_0}-\frac{a_1}{a_0}g
\] With \(c\) consumption of both workers and capitalist and \(g\) the
rate of capital accumulation \(g = \Delta{K}/K = I/K\)

These two relationships and hence trade-off between wage and profit, and
consumption and growth are the implications of the two main assumptions
explained above: \textbf{constant rate of capacity utilization} and
\textbf{given constant technology}. Technological change or rise in
\(u\) can improve the wage-profit trade-off and thus make both profits
and wage rate rise (same for consumption-growth trade-off). Graphically,
the slope of the curve above would either shift upward or one of the
intercept increase.

\hypertarget{saving-function}{%
\subsubsection{Saving function}\label{saving-function}}

The model makes here another important assumption: \textbf{all saving is
done by the capitalist class}. All savings come out from of the profits
received by the capitalists. Another important feature is the fact that
the classics and Marx did not distinguish between savings and investment
(``the purchase of newly produced capital goods, such as machinery,
equipment or structures''(p.63)). In C-M terminology, ``accumulation''
means the mechanistic flow between savings, investment and thus growth.
This leads to the ``accumulation function'':

\[
g \equiv I/K \equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})
\]

\(g \equiv I/K \equiv S/K\) (growth \(g\) is equal to the investment
rate \(I/K\) which is the same as saving rate \(S/K\)) comes from this
non-distinction between saving and investment. \(s_r\) is the proportion
capitalists save out of their profits \(r\). This equation means that
growth can increase only with an increase in the saving rate of the
capitalists.

\subsection{The three equations and the alternative
closures}\label{the-three-equations-and-the-alternative-closures}}

\hypertarget{equations}{%
\subsubsection{3 Equations}\label{equations}}

The basic model is thus based on the three main equations

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Profit-wage trade-off
\end{enumerate}

\[
w = \frac{1}{a_0}-\frac{a_1}{a_0}r

\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Accumulation function
\end{enumerate}

\[
g \equiv I/K \equiv S/K = s_r(r-r_{min})
\] However, the model is not ``closed'' in the sense that all the main
variables (w, r, s\_r, g) are endogenous (they all are a function of one
another). The model needs thus to be ``closed'' by adding an exogenous
variable. Since the classics and Marx did not give a precise and
consistent closure (exogenous variable), the textbook gives four
``alternative closures'' which come from different interpretation the
classics and Marx.

\hypertarget{alternative-closures}{%
\subsubsection{4 alternative closures}\label{alternative-closures}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An exogenously given real wage \(\bar{w}\)
\end{enumerate}

Which represents an ordinary standard of living for a working-class
family. This should not be confounded with the infamous ``iron law'' of
wages (that wages will always tend to go to the subsistence level, this
was made popular by Ferdinand Lassalle and Malthus but has nothing to do
with Marx and the classics). This exogenous wage rate \(\bar{w}\) is
given, but socially and historically determined and varies across
countries and time. This is not a natural/physical minium subsistence
wage.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Exogenous given wage share of national income
\end{enumerate}

This assumes that wages are determined through a bargaining process in
which workers can bargain with capitalists to get wages such as a given
wage share of national income is achieved. Note that the wage share can
be written as \(\psi = wa_0 = w*L/Y\) and the profit share
\(\pi = ra_1=rK/Y\). The real wage \(w\) can be written as negatively
related to the profit share \(\pi\)

\[
w = (1 - \bar{\pi})/a_0 = (1 - \bar{\pi})Q
\] With \(Q=Y/L\) labour productivity.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Full employment or constant employment
\end{enumerate}

This closures explains that wage depends on the balance between labor
demand and supply. Increase in labor demand tend to increase wages
whereas the growth in labor supply will tend to decrease wages. A rapid
growth of labor demand increase the bargaining power of workers, who can
bargain higher wages and conversely when population and labor supply
increase rapidly.

This closure states that the change in real wage \(\hat{w}\) is a
negative function of growth in labour supply \(n\)

\(\hat{w} = \phi(g - n), \phi'>0\)

Thus, wage is constant when \(g = n\)

But then, the manual (on page 71) considers another function, which
describes the growth of labor force \(n\) as a positive function of real
rage \(w\), the idea is that the higher wage leads to higher population
growth and thus higher labor supply growth:

\(n = n_0 + n_1w\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

The profit rate is determined by the interest rate on loans to firms

\subsubsection{Effects of exogenous change in propensity to

What happens if the saving propensity out of profits, \(s_r\), rise or
fall?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Closure 1 and 2

  If the propsensity to save increase, the accumulation function curve
  becomes flatter (attention: in the graph above, the y and x axis are
  inverted on the right quadrant, where the accumulation function is
  drawn. So a rise in the slope implies a flattening of the curve).
  Since the real wage (or wage change) is exgenously given, it does not
  change. What changes are the growth (accumulation) rate and
  consumption: accumulation and growth increase because more profits are
  saved and invested into new capital. Consumption decreases because
  since capitalists increase their saving propensity, less of their
  profits are dedicated to personal consumption. Conversely, if the
  saving propensity decreases, accumulations and growth decrease and
  consumption increase. The real wage and profit rate remain unchanged.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Closure 3 (natural rate of growth closure)

  An increase in the propensity to save will again make the accumulation
  curve rotate down to the right (the slope increase). The direct short
  run effect is a rise in growth rate g. Then, this increase in growth
  rate makes labor demand increase faster than labor supply, resulting
  in a rise in the real wage. The rise in real wage decreases the profit
  rate and thus the growth rate decreases until the growth of labor
  demand and labor supply are equal. Whereas the growth rate g ends up
  at the same level or higher depends if labor supply is considered as
  endogenous or exogenous. If it is endogenous, the increase in labor
  supply after the increase in real wage will be faster and the new
  equilibrium growth rate will be higher than the original level. If
  labor supply is exogenous (a vertical curve in the upper-right
  candrant), the equilibrium growth rate cannot rise in the long run and
  will return at its original level.

  Endogenous labor supply:
  \(\nearrow s_r \Rightarrow \nearrow \nearrow g, \Rightarrow \nearrow w, \searrow r \Rightarrow \nearrow n \Rightarrow \searrow g\),

  but with final g \textgreater{} initial g. Note that under these
  conditions, both the growth rate and the real wage rise.

  In this closure, a change in real wage or wage share would be the
  effect of an exognous change in population growth (and thus of labor
  supply). A rise in real wage would happen if there is a negative
  exogenous shock to population and labor supply (for instance a brutal
  epidemic like the black death, which decreased population a lot in the
  14th century and made wages rise because of labor supply scarcity).
  The curve n = n0 + n1*w shifts to the left, real wages rise, profit
  rate decreases, growth rate decreases and concumption increases.

\hypertarget{effects-of-technological-change}{%

The manual presents four types of technological change:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Harrod-neutral: pure labor saving technological change}

  Labor productivity rises, but capital productivity remains unchanged
\end{enumerate}

\(\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Hicks-neutral: factor-saving technological change}

  Both capital and labor productivity rise
\end{enumerate}

\(\nearrow Q = Y/L = 1/a_0, \nearrow Y/K = 1/a_1\)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  \textbf{Marx-biased: labor saving, capital using}

  Labor productivity increases, but capital productivity decreases
\item
  \textbf{Solow-neutral: pure capital saving technological change}

  Capital productivity rises, with labor productivity unchanged
\end{enumerate}

All those patterns of technological change, with the exception of the
marx-biased one, will improve the wage-profit trade-off, the curve of
the latter shifting outward. Wage and profit as well as growth rise.
Under the natural rate of growth closure (3) with exogenous labor
supply, the long-run growth rate does not increase, however.

\hypertarget{marx-biased-technological-change-the-falling-tendency-of-the-rate-of-profit-ftrp}{%
\subsubsection{Marx-biased technological change the falling tendency of
the rate of profit
(FTRP)}\label{marx-biased-technological-change-the-falling-tendency-of-the-rate-of-profit-ftrp}}

The FTRP is perhaps one of the most famous claim/theory of Marx. In
\emph{Capital Volume III}, Marx exposes this theory, which claims that
technological change, by increasing labor productivity while decreasing
capital productivity, will lead to a fall in the profit rate. The manual
claims that Marx makes one important but often forgotten assumption: a
constant rate of exploitation \(e = s/v\) with s the surplus value and v
the value of labor power. Blecker and Setterfield argue that assuming a
constant rate of exploitation is the same as assuming a constant wage
share and profit share.

Recall that the profit share can be written as \(r = \pi / a_1\), if
\(\pi\) the profit share is constant and marx-biased technological
change happens, \(a_1\) will increase (\(a_1\) is the inverse of capital
productivity \(a_1 = K/Y_k\)). and thus decrease profit rate \(r\).
Thus, under the constant wage share closure, Marx-biased technological
change does imply a fall in profit rate. However, it is unlikely that
capitalists will let their profit rate fall without reacting and trying
to suppress wages or slow down accumulation and growth, which would
decrease labor demand, reduce workers bargaining power and thus lead to
lower wages and to a recovery of the profit rate.

What about the third closure? Under this closure, the fall in profit
rate does not happen, mainly because of the effect of the increase in
labor supply resulting from the increase in real wage. If labor supply
is considered as exogenous, the long run profit and growth rate cannot
change: \(a_0\) falls more than real wage increase, and thus
\(\pi = 1-wa_0\) increases. Thus, the FTRP is false under this closure,
but another of Marx prediction is true: the relative immiseration of the
proletariat, since the profit share increases (and wage share
decreases).

\part{Neo-Keynesian Models}

\hypertarget{neo-keynesian-models-1}{%
\chapter{Neo-Keynesian Models}\label{neo-keynesian-models-1}}

What follows is extensively based on the third chapter of Heterodox
Macroeconomics: Models of of Demand, Distribution and Growth (2019) by
Robert A. Blecker and Mark Setterfield.

``Neo-keynesianism'' refers in our context to economic models conceived
by neo-keynesian economists, that is, economists who built their model
from the important contributions of Keynes. It here refers mainly to :

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Roy Forbes Harrod} (1900-1978), was a British economist who
  did his education and then was professor in Oxford and Cambridge,
  where he met Keynes.
\item
  \textbf{Nicholar Kaldor} (1908-1986), born in Budapest, was a British
  economist (he completed his education in Britain). What will be
  presented here as the early Kaldorian model (EKM) is based on his
  early work, in which he attempted to derive the conditions at which
  the growth rate could grow at a rate consistent with full-employment
  in the long run.
\item
  \textbf{Joan Robinson} (1903-1983), was also a British economist from
  Cambridge. She is known for her development of Keynesian theory.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{roy-harrod-a-model-of-unstable-growth}{%
\section{Roy Harrod: a Model of Unstable
Growth}\label{roy-harrod-a-model-of-unstable-growth}}

Roy Forbes Harrod (1900-1978) is an important figure in economics. The
British economist is first and foremost known for his formal description
of the mechanisms of economic growth, which one of the first attempt to
do so in the discipline. As we will see, the conclusion of Harrod's
model is that growth under capitalism is fundamentally unstable.

\hypertarget{three-growth-rates-first-and-second-harrod-problems}{%
\subsection{Three Growth Rates, First and Second Harrod
Problems}\label{three-growth-rates-first-and-second-harrod-problems}}

Harrod distiguished three growth rates:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The \emph{actual} growth rate

  The rate of growth which is actually observed in the economy
  \(y = \frac{Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t}}\)
\item
  Natural growth rate

  Which is defined as \(y_N = q + n\), with n the rate of growth of
  labour and q the rate of growth of labor productivity.
\end{enumerate}

This rate of growth comes from the definition of ouput at the
full-employment level: \(Y_N = \frac{N}{a_0}\) with
\(a_0 = \frac{N}{Y}\) the labour-output ratio (how much labour is
required per unit of output). The rate of change of \(Y_N\) is
\(\widehat{Y_N} = n - \widehat{a_0}\). Since \(a_0\) is also the inverse
of labour productivity \(\frac{1}{a_0} = Y/L\), \(-\widehat{a}\) is
equivalent to labour productivity growth \(\widehat{Q} = q\).

This natural rate of growth can be interpreted as an upper limit, the
maximum rate of growth that can be achieved in the long run at full
employment. The limit comes from the fact that production (output level)
is limited by labour supply constraint (since \(Y_N\) is the maximum
level of output at full-employment).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Warranted rate of growth

  Which is the rate of growth when investment is equal to savings
  \(S = I\).
\end{enumerate}

How can we found this third rate of growth? We must first define the
investment function (how the model thinks investment decisions are
made):

\[
I_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})
\]

With \(I_t\) investment at period \(t\), \(a1\) the full-capacity
capital--output ratio (quantity of capital required to produce any given
level of output) \(a_1 = \frac{K}{Y_K}\). This ratio can also be
interpreted here as the additional quantity of capital needed to produce
any additional output (the ``at the margins'' interpretation). This
equation simply means that if agents at time \(t-1\) expect output a the
next period \(t\) to be higher, \(Y^e_t > Y_{t-1}\), then investment at
the next period \(t\) will be equal this this positive difference
multiplied by the full-capacity capital--output ratio.

Why multiply by \(a_1\) ? If we define the actual quantity of capital
which is utilized in the economy as \(K_u = uK\), \(u\) being the full
capacity utilization rate \(u = Y/Y_k\), we can rewrite the actual
quantity of utilized capital as \(K_u = uK = \frac{Y}{Y_k}K = a_1Y\)

The change of the amount of capital actually used in the production
process is thus \(\Delta{K_u} = a_1\Delta{Y}\)

Investment basically means that new capital is bought and added to the
stock of capital available for production: \(I = \Delta{K}\), so that
when investment occurs, capital stock increases by \(\Delta K\). If we
consider that expectations are realized, \(\Delta{Y} = \Delta{Y^e}\), we
can write

\[
I = \Delta K = a_1\Delta Y = \Delta K_u = a_1\Delta{Y}
\] Thus, \(a_1\) is not arbitrary, but conformed to the known quantity
of capital required to expand production through investment.

We have thus the investment function:

\[
I_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})
\] The saving function, on the other hand, is equal to:

\[
S_t = sY_t
\]

With \(s\) the propensity to save. This saving function simply means
that the total saving is a fixed proportion of total income
(production).

The last steps to find the warranted rate of growth is to equate the
savings and investment function, after making the assumption that
expectations are realized:

\[
\begin{aligned}
Y_t = Y^e_t 
\\
S_t = I_t 
\\
s_tY = a_1(Y_t - Y_{t-1}) 
\\
\frac{s}{a_1} = \frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}
\end{aligned}
\]

The warranted rate of growth is thus

\[y_w = \frac{s}{a_1}\]

To sum up, the three rates of growth are

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Actual Growth Rate}
\end{enumerate}

\(y = \frac{Y_t-Y_{t-1}}{Y_t}\)

\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Warranted Growth Rate}
\end{enumerate}

\(y_w = \frac{s}{a_1}\)

\hypertarget{the-first-harrod-problem}{%
\subsection{The First Harrod Problem}\label{the-first-harrod-problem}}

The first Harrod problem states that there is no mechanisms that would
ensure a persistent or non-accidental equality between the three growth
rates, thus the equality

\[
y = \frac{s}{a_1} = \bar{q} + \bar{n}
\] is possible, but as the manual puts it, \emph{not likely}. The reason
is that what influences the warranted rate of growth and the natural
rate of growth are independent of each other.

\hypertarget{the-second-harrod-problem}{%
\subsection{The Second Harrod Problem}\label{the-second-harrod-problem}}

The second Harrod problem states that the warranted rate of growth
\(y_w = s/a_1\) is unstable. That means that any deviation of the rate
of growth from the warranted rate will be self-reinforcing.

To see this, we start with the equality between savings and investment:

\[
\begin{aligned}
I = S
\\
I_t = sY_t
\\
Y_t = \frac{I_t}{s}
\\
\end{aligned}
\]

Then by substituting \(I_t\) by the investment function
\(I_t = a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})\):

\[
Y_t = \frac{a_1(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1})}{s} = \frac{Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}}{y_w}
\] Note that here \(a_1/s\) is the inverse of the warranted rate of
growth \(y_w\), this is why \(y_w\) appears at the denominator. If we
divide both sides of the equation above by the expected rate of growth
\(Y^e_t\), we get:

\[\frac{Y_t}{y^e_t} = \frac{y^e}{y_w}\]

\(y^e\) comes from the fact that we divided \(Y^e_t - Y_{t-1}\) by
\(Y^e_t\), which is the rate of growth of expected growth rate. This
equation above simply shows that, if expectations are realized
(\(Y_t = Y^e_t\), this is a condition for the warranted rate of growth),
and \(y^e = y_w\), then we have an equilibrium between the actual growth
rate and warranted growth rate

\[y^e = y = y_w\]

The second Harrod problem explains that any deviation of \(y\) from
\(y_w\) will be self-reinforcing. If \(y<y_w\), there will be a
downwards pressure on \(y\), thus a persistent recession. Conversely, if
\(y>y_w\), there will be an upwards pressure on \(y\), hence a
self-reinforcing economic expansion.

These mechanisms are the results of how the model conceive the change of
the expected growth rate \(y^e_t\). If at period \(t\) the growth rate
\(y_t\) is greater than the expected growth rate \(y_t>y^e_t\), then at
period \(t+1\) agents will revise their expected growth rate upward
\(y^e_{t+1} > y^e_t\). This simple behavioral principle can be
summarized as:

\[y_t > y^e_t \Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} >y^e_t\]

\[y_t < y^e_t \Rightarrow y^e_{t+1} <y^e_t\]

}

\caption{Instability of the Warranted rate of Growth}

\end{figure}

The graph above shows that any deviation from the equilibrium point, at
which \(y_w = y = y^e\) will lead either to permanent boom or bust. Note
that the second Harrod problem depends on how expectations are revised:
here we consider expectations as adaptive: expectations will be based on
what happened at the previous period.

\hypertarget{interactions-between-actual-warranted-and-natural-growth-rates}{%
\subsection{Interactions between actual, warranted and natural growth
rates}\label{interactions-between-actual-warranted-and-natural-growth-rates}}

Two scenarios can be considered.

First, when \(y_w<y_N\), the economy will be prone to boom and bust
behavior. If the actual growth rate is greater than the warranted growth
rate, the former will be ever-increasing until the economy will
``overheat'' when the actual growth rate is superior to the natural rate
(which is an upper limit above which there will be exhaustion of labor
force and a likely wage-inflation spiral).

Second, if \(y_w>y_N\), the economy is in a situation of chronic
depression. Since the actual growth rate cannot be permanently equal to
the warranted rate in this situation (because of the upper limit
\(y_N\)), the actual rate of growth would tend to permanently fall until
government policies would likely start to intervene.

Finally, this model has consequence for economic policy. Increasing the
saving propensity \(s\) to boost growth is not a good idea if it is not
accompanied by a rise in aggregate demand, in which case increased
saving means reduced consumption demand and investment demand is not
guaranteed to offset the fall in consumption.

\section{The Early Kaldorian Model (EKM) of Growth and
Distribution}\label{the-early-kaldorian-model-ekm-of-growth-and-distribution}}

\hypertarget{a-model-very-close-to-the-classical-marxian-model}{%
\subsection{A model very close to the Classical-Marxian
model}\label{a-model-very-close-to-the-classical-marxian-model}}

This model is very close to the Classical-Marxian model I described
\href{https://jeylal.github.io/myblog/economics_series/classical-marxian\%20model/classical-marxian\%20model.html}{here}.
The main difference is the fact that the early Kaldorian model (EKM)
includes \textbf{the saving propensity out of wages} \(s_w\) whereas the
classical-marxian model only includes savings out of profits.

Recall that the classical-marxian saving function was

\(S/K= s_r(r-r_min)\)

The EKM introduces savings out of wages, with a propensity lower than
savings out of profits. Total savings is thus a weighted average bewteen
savings out of wages and profits:

\[S = [(1-\pi)s_w+\pi s_r]Y\]

\(\pi\) is the profit share, \((1-\pi)\) the wage share, with
\(0<s_w < s_r<1\).

\hypertarget{ekm-assumptions}{%
\subsection{EKM Assumptions}\label{ekm-assumptions}}

The model makes some assumptions, which are globally similar to the C-M
model:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  EKM assumes that labor productivity is constant \(q=0\), hence the
  natural rate of growth is simply \(y_N=n\).
\item
  Like the Classical-Marxian model, growth rate is the rate of capital
  accumulation \(g = \Delta K/K\).
\item
  Full or constant capacity rate of utilization \(u\)
\item
  Constancy and exogenous capital-output and labor-output ratios
  \(a_0,a_1\)
\end{enumerate}

To maintain full employment, capital accumulate rate must grow the same
as the investment rate and labor supply growth rate:

\(g = \frac{I}{K} = n\)

\hypertarget{ekm-equilibrium}{%
\subsection{EKM Equilibrium}\label{ekm-equilibrium}}

As usual, we equate \(S = I\), to find the equilibrium:

\[g = n = \frac{I}{K} = \frac{S}{K} = \frac{[(1-\pi)s_w+\pi s_r]Y}{K} = \frac{(s_r-s_w)\pi + s_w}{a_1}\]

The equilibrium profit share is thus

\[\pi^* = \frac{a_1 n - s_w}{s_r - s_w}\]

And the equilibrium growth rate is

\[g^* = n = \frac{s^*}{a_1}\]

A major difference with the C-M model is that instead of considering an
exogenous wage share or real wage and deriving the profit rate and
growth rate from it, Kaldor set the growth rate equal to its natural
rate and derive the profit/wage share and saving propensity necessary to
reach this equilibrium. For the EKM to work, wage and profit shares must
be flexible, there must be active government stabilization policies
(fiscal \& monetary).

EKM has the implications that for the economy to grow faster only with
higher inequality.

\hypertarget{neo-robinsonian-model}{%
\section{Neo-Robinsonian Model}\label{neo-robinsonian-model}}

The major point of this model is to introduce a separation between
investment and savings. All the models we saw until now did not
distinguish between savings and investment (as the classical-marxian
model).

\hypertarget{separating-savings-from-investment}{%
\subsection{Separating Savings from
Investment}\label{separating-savings-from-investment}}

The main equations of the model are thus a saving function out of
profits and a desired investment as a positive function of expected
profits.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Saving function}
\end{enumerate}

\[\sigma = s_rr\] With \(\sigma\) savings.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Desired investment function}
\end{enumerate}

\[g = f(r^e)\]

\(g\) being investment. This function is assumed to have positive but
diminishing marginal impact of expected profits on desired investment
(\(f'>0, f''<0\)).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=4.16667in,height=\textheight]{images/robinson.jpg}

}

\caption{Robinson ``banana diagram''}

\end{figure}

Point A on the graph above is a stable equilibrium whereas point B is an
unstable one. The graph has to be read as follows: at \(r_0\) the saving
rate is smaller than the (desired) growth rate \(g_0\). At \(g_0\), the
corresponding profit rate is \(r_1\), which is above the profit rate
related to actual saving rate (\(r_0\)). Firms have thus invested in way
that will make profits rise and they will thus revise their profits
expectations upwards: at \(r_1\) they will invest at a level slighlty
above \(g_0\), which will again push up the profit rate until point A,
at which \(g=\sigma\) is reached.

On the other hand, if we start at any profit rate below point B, the
desired rate of investment will lead to a growth rate that will lead in
return to a lower profit rate, firms will revise their profit rate
expectations downwards and thus reduce their desired rate of investment,
which will then lead to an even lower growth and profit rates and so on.
Below point B, this process does not end automatically, there must be
for example government stabilization. Above point A, however, the
process is the same as described above in this paragraph, but it
stabilizes at point A. Note that what happens below point B is strongly
similar to the second Harrod problem.

\hypertarget{connecting-neo-robinsonian-model-with-wage-profit-relationship}{%
\subsection{Connecting Neo-Robinsonian Model with Wage-Profit
Relationship}\label{connecting-neo-robinsonian-model-with-wage-profit-relationship}}

The Neo-Robinsonian model combines the model above with the inverse
wage-profit relationship we saw in the C-M model. The desired investment
rate is simplified to

\(g = f_0+f_1r^e\)

With the same saving function \(\sigma = s_rr\) and the inverse
profit-wage relationship \(w =\frac{1-a_1 r}{a_0}\)

To find the equilibrium levels of growth, profit and wage rates, we set
investment equals to savings \(\sigma = g\) and solve for:

\[r^* = \frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1}\]

and

\[g^*=\frac{s_rf_0}{s_r-f_1}\]

and

\[w^* = \frac{1}{a_0} - \frac{a_1}{a_0}(\frac{f_0}{s_r-f_1})\]

Note that in this model the \textbf{real wage and wage share are
flexible, but nominal wage is not}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.32292in,height=\textheight]{images/neorobinson.jpg}

}

\caption{Neo-robinsonian model}

\end{figure}

In this model, an increase in the propensity to save leads to lower
equilibrium level of growth and profit rates and a higher equilibrium
real wage. The mechanism is that an increase in the propensity to save,
with an unchanged desired investment curve (which means that saving
propensity increases without changing firms' willingness to invest),
reduces aggregate demand through a reduction in consumption demand. With
falling demand, profits realized from actual investment expenditures
also fall.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=5.32292in,height=\textheight]{images/neorobinson2.jpg}

}

\caption{Effect of an increase in saving propensity}

\end{figure}

Graphically, the saving curve rotates down to the right. Why does the
real wage increase? Recall that in this model, nominal wage is fixed. A
change in real wage must then come from a change in the price level. In
the case of higher propensity to save, the latter has depressed
aggregate demand and growth, which reduces the price level
\(\searrow P\).

What if we consider a shift in the desired investment curve? An exemple
would be a rise in \(f_0\), which can be interpreted as the level of
confidence of firms: the higher their confidence in the economy, the
higher they will invest for every level of expected profit rates. A rise
in \(f_0\) would shift the desired investment curve \(g = f_0+f_1r\) to
the right, profit rate would rise, growth rate would rise, but real wage
would decrease. Real wage decreases because inflation increases as a
result of higher aggregate demand and thus excess demand in the goods
market. Note that inflation in the Neo-robinsonian model is always
``demand-pushed'', that is, led by excess or lower demand in the market
for goods and services.

\hypertarget{marglins-neo-marxianneo-keynesian-synthesis}{%
\section{Marglin's neo-Marxian/neo-Keynesian
synthesis}\label{marglins-neo-marxianneo-keynesian-synthesis}}

Since the assumption of fixed real wage was considered not very
realistic, since it is very likely that workers would bargain for higher
wages in the case of higher inflation as described above, Marglin has
constructed model which is a mixed between the classical-marxian model
and the neo-robinsonian model. Marglin's contribution was to consider
that workers bargain for nominal wages rather than the real wage or wage
share.

Marglin's synthesis add two functions, which model the change in nominal
wage and price level.

\hypertarget{change-in-nominal-wage}{%
\subsection{Change in nominal wage}\label{change-in-nominal-wage}}

\(\hat{W} = \Omega (\bar{w} - w)\)

With \(\bar{w}\) the target real wage for workers and \(\Omega\) a
constant describing how fast change in nominal wage adjusts to the
difference between the target real wage and the real wage
\((\bar{w} - w)\). If the target real wage is greater than the actual
real wage, workers are willing and are able to bargain for higher wages.

\hypertarget{change-in-price}{%
\subsection{Change in price}\label{change-in-price}}

\(\hat{P} = \Phi (g^d-g)\)

With

\(g^d = f_0 + f_1r\) (assuming \(r^e = r\))

The desired investment function, which means that the desired investment
rate (\(g^d\)) is a positive function of the profit rate (assumed to be
equal to the expected rate).

And

\(g = s_rr\)

The saving function, which is also a positive function of profit rate.

Thus, \(\hat{P} = \Phi (g^d-g)\), means that inflation (persistent
change in price level: \(\hat{P}\)) is always the result of excess
demand in the goods market, excess demand due to the fact that
\(g^d>g\), demand related to investment (demand for tools, machinery,
equipment\ldots).

This price level change equation captures an important assumption of the
neo-keynesian models that inflation is always \textbf{``demand-led''},
that is, led by excessive demand in the goods market. Another assumption
is the constancy of the capital to full capacity output ratio \(a_1\)
(constant technology).

\hypertarget{dynamics-of-the-model}{%
\subsection{Dynamics of the Model}\label{dynamics-of-the-model}}

The equilibrium condition of the model, which will determine growth,
real wage and profit rate, is the equality between price change and
nominal wage change:

\[\widehat{W} = \widehat{P}\]

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/marglinsynthesis.jpg}

}

\caption{Marglin's Classical-Marxian - NeoRobinsonian synthesis}

\end{figure}

At this equilibrium, the real wage \(W/P\) is constant. The other
variables behave as such:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the target real wage increase \(\bar{w}\), equilibrium profit rate
  decreases, real wage increases, growth rate decreases and equilibrium
  inflation increases.
\item
  If \(f_0\), firms' confidence in the economy, increases, equilibrium
  inflation increases, equilibrium profit rate and growth rate also
  increase and equilibrium real wage decreases.
\item
  If the propensity \(s_r\) to save increases, equilibrium profit rate
  and inflation decrease, but the impact on growth is ambiguous: on the
  one hand growth is constrained by available savings (and thus if
  savings increase growth can increase) but on the other hand, growth
  can also decrease because of the fall in profit rate.
\end{itemize}

An important contribution of this model is to make explicit the argument
about \textbf{inflation}, which was only implicit in the previous
neo-keynesian models (Robinson, Kaldor\ldots). An crucial point is that
the model assumes that \textbf{inflation is always driven by demand}
(excess demand in the goods market). A critic adressed to this model is
that inflation is not only ``demand-pull'' but can also be
``cost-push'', that is, driven positively by an increase in firms'
markups due to an increase in costs.

Another critic concerns that inflation caused by the difference between
\(g^d>g\) is not very realistic because it implies that firms will
always want to invest at a rate they cannot achieve.

\subsection{Biographical notes, authors and
sources}\label{biographical-notes-authors-and-sources}}

Michał Kalecki (1899-1970) was a Polish economist and major figure of
heterodox and Post-Keynesian economics. He made important contributions
in macroeconomics and political economy, and his work represents a
crucial legacy for a lot of contemporary work in heterodox economics.

The models that will be presented here are related to the macroeconomics
of Kalecki. Kalecki (1954) is often considered as the work which laid
out the foundations of Kalecki's macroeconomics that will be exposed
here.

However, it is important to keep in mind that Kalecki also developed a
theory of political business cycles (I talk shortly about this theory
\href{https://jeylal.github.io/myblog/posts/About\%20cycles\%20and\%20crises/cycles_crises.html}{here})
Kalecki (1943). What will be presented here (based on the manual Blecker
and Setterfield (2019)) will be hence just a part of the (many)
important contributions of Kalecki in political economy and
macroeconomics.

The Neo-Kaleckian model is actually posterior to Kalecki (hence
``Neo''), but heavily based on his work. It was developed by Kaleckian
economists in the 70s and 80s based on Kalecki's work, but also on the
work of Josef Steindl (1912-1993), an Austrian Post-Keynesian economist
who was a close collegue of Kalecki. The first Neo-Kaleckian model that
will be presented here is called by Blecker and Setterfield (2019) the
``Kaleckian-Steindl'' model and is based on Post-Keynesian writings in
the 70s and 80s, for instance Harris (1974) (Donald J. Harris who is by
the way the father of Kemala Harris, current vice-president of the
United-States) and Asimakopulos (1975).

Until now, almost all the heterodox models summarized until now, the
Classical-Marxian models (CMMs) and the Neo-Keynesian models (NKMs),
explain that more rapid growth can only be achieve at the expense of a
more unequal distribution of income. In other words, the CMMs and NKMs
explain that increasing the rate of growth implies more inequality
through either lower real wage or lower wage share.

One major flaw of the CMMs and NKMs is that they either don't
incorporate the important role of aggregate demand in the analysis (in
the case of the CMMs) or only partially incorporate it (for the NKMs).
Why is it important to take aggregate demand into account when one wants
to analyze the determinants of economic growth? Before answering this
question, let's first remind ourserlves what aggregate demand is. The
latter can be defined as the \textbf{sum of all demand sources for goods
and services in an economy}.

\hypertarget{aggregate-demand}{%
\subsection{Aggregate Demand}\label{aggregate-demand}}

Aggregate demand is often summarized with the following accounting
identity:

\[Y^d \equiv C+I+G+(X-M)\]

With \(Y^d\) aggregate demand, which depends positively:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(C\), private consumption demand (by individuals, not firms nor the
  government, nor foreigners). \(C\) is the sum of all private
  consumption in a given economy.
\item
  \(I\), investment demand. The latter represents all purchases of
  capital goods by firms and all new residential investment. It includes
  mainly the purchase by firms of machinery, tools, raw materials and
  other equipment. However, residential investment (purchase of new
  houses) is also considered as an investment in national accounts.
\item
  \(G\), the demand coming from government purchases of goods and
  services.
\item
  \(X\), the demand coming from purchase by foreigners of national goods
  and services. It represents all exportation made by the economy.
  Subtracted by \(M\), which is imported goods and services, we get the
  trade balance.
\end{itemize}

Why is aggregate demand important? Because any increase in demand gives
impetus to economic expansion: the higher the demand for goods and
services, the more firms will want to respond by producing more. Demand
does not mechanically accommodate to supply, as it is assumed in CMMs
and NKMs. The idea that demand can never be a constraint to production
is know as \emph{Say's Law}: demand will always accommodate supply
because supply creates demand by itself. For instance, if I produce
coffee beans, I will either consume it or want to trade it for other
goods or services: my production has thus create at the same time my
demand. It may sound paradoxical to say that CMMs and NKMs implicitly
accepted Say's Law or at least did not put it into question since Marx,
Keynes and Post-Neo-Keynesian economists are famous for their critic of
Say's law.

Nonetheless, the Neo-Kaleckian models presented below are the firsts to
really put Say's Law into question and put aggregrate demand at the
center. The (neo)-kaleckian models are thus very important among
heterdox models of economic growth, because it the former incorporates
the role of aggregate demand and its impact on growth, even in the long
run.

\hypertarget{main-characteristics-of-the-model}{%
\section{Main characteristics of the
model}\label{main-characteristics-of-the-model}}

\hypertarget{capacity-rate-of-utilization}{%
\subsection{Capacity rate of
utilization}\label{capacity-rate-of-utilization}}

The main difference of the Neo-Kaleckian model with the CMMs and NKMs is
that the Neo-Kaleckian model does not make the assumption that the
capacity rate of utilization is fixed, constant, or constant at full
level \(u = 1\). But what is the rate of capacity utilization already?

The rate of capacity utilization \(u\) is the ratio of actual output
\(Y\) to the full-capacity output \(Y_k\), which is the output level
when all capital is used in the economy. The capacity rate can be thus
written as

\[u = \frac{Y}{Y_k}\] If we consider, as the CMMs and NKMs, that
\(u = 1\), we simply say that \(Y = Y_k\). In other words, \(u = 1\)
means that all capital is used in the production process in the economy.
If, for instance, \(u = 0.5\), that means that actual output is only
half of what it could be if all capital was used in production.

A major characteristics of the Neo-Kaleckian model is that the model
considers that the capacity rate \(u\) is flexible and not equal to one:
the level of output is thus never at its full capacity level, contrary
to the previous models presented in the manual.

\hypertarget{reasons-why-u1}{%
\subsubsection{3 Reasons why u\textless1}\label{reasons-why-u1}}

Why does the Neo-Kaleckian model has such a conception of the capacity
rate? There are three main reasons for which firms do not operate at
full capacity (full utilization of capital).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Indivisibilities}

  Firms tend to purchase capital goods (machinery, raw materials,
  tools\ldots) which can be obtained only in large and discontinuous
  units, and thus can be operated at less than 100 per cent of their
  potential.
\item
  \emph{Building ahead of demand}

  Since firms do not know and cannot know what the demand for their
  products will be in the future (fundamental uncertainty of the
  future), they will hold excess capacity (excess capital not used in
  production) in case if demand rise in the future. If firms did not
  hold excess capacity and if demand suddenly happened to rise, they
  would not be able to respond by increasing production.
\item
  \emph{Entry deterrence}

  Most large firms operate in a non-competitive (great number of
  competitive firms) framework, in which only a few large oligopolistic
  firms compete in the market. In this situation, these large firms will
  hold excess capacity as a weapon in case if new firms (new entrants)
  would want to enter the market as producers and compete with the
  established firms. Having excess capacity allows established firms to
  be able to rise production immediately and thus push price downwards
  to crush any potential new competitors.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{prices-as-markups-over-costs}{%
\subsection{Prices as markups over
costs}\label{prices-as-markups-over-costs}}

In most models described until now, none of them had a precise
model/equation describing how prices are set by firms. The Neo-Kaleckian
has an explicit and precise definition of how prices are set. Recall
that in the context of perfect competition, standard economic theory
tells that prices are the result of the equilibrium between demand and
supply. In the Neo-Kaleckian framework, markets are not perfectly
competitive and firms have what economics call ``market power'', that
is, the power to influence prices and thus set the latter.

How will firms then set prices in the Neo-Kaleckian model? The manual
presents the following price equation:

\[P = (1 + \tau)Wa_0\]

Which means that a firm will increase price \(P\) if it decides to rise
its markup rate \(\tau\), or if nominal wage increase \(W\) (since
nominal wage is a cost for the firm, note that here other costs are
ignored for simplicity and only labor costs are taken into account), or
if \(a_0 = \frac{L}{Y}\), the labor/output ratio increases. Here, \(Y\)
refers to the output produced by the firm and \(L\) the amount of labor
employed by the firm. The idea that prices are not determined by demand
and supply equilibrium, but by markup over costs is called \emph{markup
pricing}.

Once the markup pricing equation is defined, it can be shown that the
profit share \(\pi\) is a positive (monotonic) function of markup
\(\tau\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\pi = \frac{P - Wa_0}{P}
\\
= \frac{(1+\tau)Wa_0-Wa_0}{(1+\tau)Wa_0}
\\
\pi = \frac{\tau}{1+\tau}
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus,

\[\pi = \frac{\tau}{1+\tau}\] The higher the markup \(\tau\), the higher
the profit share.

What will influence change in the markup rate \(\tau\), and thus
\emph{increase profit share and inequality}? Kalecki and the manual give
five main factors which will influence the markup (a + or - sign is
added next to each factor to indicate whether it rises the markup or
decreases it):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Industrial concentration} (+)

  The fewer the firms are in competition with each other, the less the
  market is competitive and the more firms have market power to increase
  prices through an increase in their markup.
\item
  \textbf{`Overheads' or fixed costs} (+)

  By these overhead and fixed costs, we mean all the costs associated
  with machinery and equipment, management, maintenance (overhead
  labor), Research \& Development expenses, intellectual property rights
  costs or debt service expenses. All these costs are taken into account
  by firms, which want to set price with a markup over these costs. If
  these costs increase, firms will also want to increase the markup to
  set a prices bringing enough revenues.
\item
  \textbf{Sales effort} (+)

  When firms operate under an oligopolistic framework (few firms, low
  competition between firms), adverstising is important to increase the
  number of consumers. Moreover, adverstising is also useful for
  'product differentiation'', that is, convincing consumers that the
  firm's products are different than the other products offered in the
  market. Consumers would then be more disposed to consume the
  differentiated product at a higher price. Advertising is thus both a
  way to increase the number of consumers and a way to increase
  oligopolistic market power.
\item
  \textbf{Strength of labour unions} (-)

  If workers within a firm have enough bargaining power, they may are
  able to capture parts of the firms's potential profits. The degree of
  power workers can have depend on the existence and strength of labor
  unions: the more labor unions there are and the stronger and more
  well-organized and powerful they are, they more firms will have to
  share their value added, and thus decrease their markups.
\item
  \textbf{External competition} (-)

  The more national firms are in competition with the rest of the world,
  the more competitive pressure they have to lower their price, and thus
  their markup.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{new-wage-profit-relationship}{%
\subsection{New wage-profit
relationship}\label{new-wage-profit-relationship}}

As with the CMMs, we start with the definition of national income under
the income approach: national income is the sum of capitalists and
workers' income (profits and wages, ignoring depreciation, no
government, only one good):

\[PY = WL + rPK\] Dividing by \(PY\), we get a new inverse wage profit
relationship:

\[w = \frac{1}{a_0} - \frac{a_1}{a_0} \frac{r}{u}\]

This equation is almost the same as the one we derived in the
\href{https://jeylal.github.io/myblog/economics_series/classical-marxian\%20model/classical-marxian\%20model.html\#basis-of-the-model}{classical-marxian
models}. Since the CMMs assumed a full and constant capacity rate of
utilization \(u = 1\), it does not appear in their wage-profit equation.
However, \(u\) appears here in the denominator of the \(r/u\) fraction
because it is assumed to be inferior to one (below full capacity) and
flexible. In the equation above, wage appears to be a positive function
of \(u\), but this is misleading since \(u\) and profit rate \(r\) are
not independent of each other, meaning that if one of the two variables
increases, the other will change as well, leaving an ambiguous impact on
real wage \(w\).

The graph above shows the inverse wage-profit relationship when the
capacity rate is equal to one (u = 1), as in the CMMs, and when it is
inferior to one, as in the Neo-Kaleckian models. \textbf{A rise in u
allows for both the profit rate and the real wage to rise}.

Recall that real wage \(w\) is \(W/P\). By replacing \(P\) by the price
equation we saw above (\(P = (1 + \tau)Wa_0\)), we can see how the real
wage is related to income distribution and inequality:

\[
\begin{aligned}
w = \frac{W}{P} = \frac{W}{(1+\tau)Wa_0} = (\frac{1}{1+\tau})\frac{1}{a_0}
\\
w = \frac{1 - \pi}{a_0}
\end{aligned}
\]

To sum up, we have

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Real wage as a positive function of wage share \(\psi = 1-\pi\), labor
  productivity \(1/a_0\), utilization rate \(u = Y/Y_K\) and negative
  with profit rate \(r\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(w = \frac{1 - \pi}{a_0}\)
  \item
    \(w = \frac{1}{a_0} - \frac{a_1}{a_0} \frac{r}{u}\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Profit rate as a positive function of profit share \(\pi\),
  utilization rate \(u\), and capital productivity \(1/a_1\); and profit
  share \(\pi\) as a positive function of markup \(\tau\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(r = \frac{\pi u}{a_1}\)
  \item
    \(\pi = \frac{\tau}{1+\tau}\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model Solution and
Equilibrium}\label{model-solution-and-equilibrium}}

As usual, the equilibrium values of our variables of interest (growth
rate, profit rate, real wage\ldots) will be determined by the
equilibrium between savings and investment. To do so, we must first
define the saving and investment functions.

\hypertarget{saving-function-1}{%
\subsection{Saving function}\label{saving-function-1}}

The saving function is essentially the same as in the NKMs: all savings
come out of profits (\textbf{no savings out of wages}):

\[\sigma = s_rr\] \textbf{Assuming that:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All savings come out of profits
\item
  Closed economy (no foreign trade)
\item
  No government
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{investment-function}{%
\subsection{Investment function}\label{investment-function}}

Unlike the saving function, the Neo-Kaleckian function has a major
difference with NKMs. The difference is that investment is now not only
a positive function of actual profits \(r\), but also of the capacity
rate of utilization \(u\):

\[g = g_0+g_1r+g_2u\]

Recall that the Neo-Robinsonian model considered that investment was a
positive function, not of realized profits, but of expected profits. The
Neo-Kaleckian model considers that investment if a positive function of
actual profits because the latter influences investment decisions by
relieving financial and liquidity constraints.

Regarding the capacity rate \(u = Y/Y_k\), if this variable increases
(meaning that a given firm is utilizing more unused capital, for
instance to catch up with a rise in demand), firms will want to invest
more to keep excess capacity (recall that firms in this model want to
keep a certain level of excess capacity, the reasons are listed at the
beginning).

Replacing \(u\) using the profit equation \(r = \frac{\pi u}{a_1}\), the
investment function can be written as a function of profit rate and
profit share:

\[g = g_0+(g_1+g_2a_1/\pi)r\]

\hypertarget{saving-investment-equilibrium}{%
\subsection{Saving-Investment
Equilibrium}\label{saving-investment-equilibrium}}

\hypertarget{deriving-equilibrium}{%
\subsubsection{Deriving Equilibrium}\label{deriving-equilibrium}}

Equalizing Investment and Savings equation, we get:

\[
\sigma = g
\]

Replacing \(\sigma\) and \(g\) by their respective definition, we get:

\[s_rr= g_0+g_1r+g_2u\]

Then we replace the profit rate \(r\) by \(\frac{\pi u}{a_1}\):

\[s_r\frac{\pi u}{a_1}= g_0+g_1\frac{\pi u}{a_1}+g_2u\]

Solving for (isolating on the left) the capacity rate \(u\), we get:

\[
u^* = \frac{g_0}{(s_r-g_1)(\pi/a_1)-g_2}
\]

The equilibrium capacity rate is thus a positive function of \(g_0\)
(firms' confidence in the economy), of \(g_2\) (effect of a one unit
increase in \(u\) on investment), of \(g_1\) (degree of positive
response of profit rate on investment)

On the other hand, \(u^*\) is negative function of \(\pi\) (profit
share), and of \(a_1\) (and thus positive function of labor productivity
\(1/a_1\)).

The equilibrium profit rate is:

\[
r^* = \frac{g_0 (\pi / a_1)}{(s_r-g_1)(\pi / a_1)-g_2}
\]

The latter increase with: \(g_0, g_1, g_2\) and decrease with \(s_r\).

Equilibrium savings and investment are:

\[
g^*=\sigma^*=\frac{s_r g_0(\pi/a_1)}{(s_r-g_1)(\pi /a_1)-g_2}
\]

Which are thus positive functions of \(g_0, g_1, g_2\)

\hypertarget{vizualizing-equilibrium}{%
\subsubsection{Vizualizing Equilibrium}\label{vizualizing-equilibrium}}

The Neo-Kaleckian model can be graphed using the three main equations of
the model:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Real Wage: \(w = \frac{1}{a_0} - \frac{a_1}{a_0} \frac{r}{u}\)
\item
  Savings: \(\sigma = s_rr\)
\item
  Investment: \(g = g_0+(g_1+g_2a_1/\pi)r\)
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

Some remarks about the graph above and the main equations:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The more firms have excess capacity, the more \(u\) will be inferior
  to one, and the more the curve on the left (wage-profit curve) will
  rotate down to the right (because the intercept on the r axis will go
  down).
\item
  Rates of utilization \(u\) , profit rate \(r\) and real wage \(w\) are
  mutually and simultaneously determined.
\item
  A rise in profit share \(\pi\) will make the investment curve rotate
  to the left.
\item
  A rise or fall in wage and profit share depends on technology and
  markup.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{main-results-of-the-neo-kaleckian-model}{%
\section{Main Results of the Neo-Kaleckian
model}\label{main-results-of-the-neo-kaleckian-model}}

The main implication of the Neo-Kaleckian (Kalecki-Steindl) model is
that faster economic growth can be achieved through a more equal
distribution of income, rising real wage and profit rates. These
conclusions of the model are very different from CMMs and NKMs, in which
faster growth can only happen with greater inequality.

This stand is sharp contrast with the CMMs and NKMs, which tell that
faster growth comes at the expense of real wages, wage share and thus
with more inequality. The difference lies in the fact that, in most CMMs
and NKMs, the rate of capacity utilization is considered constant at
full level \(u = 1\), so that a simultaneous increase in profit rates,
real wage and growth can happen only if there is technological change
(except a Marx-biased technological change), which is also considered
exogenous.

This Neo-Kaleckian model thus implies that growth can be
\emph{wage-led}, which means that faster growth can be achieved with a
more equal distribution of income: higher real wage and wage share allow
for faster growth. We arrived to this result mainly by introducing
markups in the model and a flexible capacity rate.

But what is the logic behind wage-led growth? Think for example of what
would happen if the profit share rises in an economy. A rise in profit
share implies a redistribution of income from wages to profits. Since,
in this model, 100\% of wages are consumed whereas only a fraction of
profits are consumed (\(1-s_r\)), a rise in profit share reduces total
consumption demand in the economy. A fall in consumption demand will
then slow down growth, because there are less outlets for finished
products and services to be sold and consumed. Note that this mechanism
looks a lot to underconsumption theory expressed by some Marxists.

Keep in mind that it could be possible for a fall consumption (due to a
fall in real wage) to be offset by a rise in investment (firms have more
income, and thus can invest more). In this model, not only this is not
possible, but if the profit share rises (and wage share declines), even
investment itself falls because of a fall in utilization rate and
realized profits. This is a paradoxical result in which there is an
inverse \textbf{relationship between profit share and profit rates}.
Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) argue that the specification of the
investment function, which double counts the capacity rate, is the
reason behind this paradox. But logically, this paradox is due to the
fact that, when profit share \(\pi\) rises, the negative effect of the
decline in consumption demand out of wages is so strong that capacity
rate \(u\) falls more than profit share \(\pi\) rises, making the profit
rate \(r = \pi u/a_1\) fall.

The graph below shows the negative effect of rise in the profit share.
The investment curve \(g\) rotates to the left and the wage-profit curve
rotates down to the right:

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

This Neo-Kaleckian model, also called Kalecki-Steindl model, has strong
differences with CMMs and NKMs. First, the \textbf{rate of capacity
utilization} \(u = Y/Y_k\) is \textbf{considered flexible}, inferior to
one, and has a positive impact on investment. Second, the model defines
prices and profit share as positive functions of markup \(\tau\), which
depends on the five factors listed at the beginning of this chapter. A
higher markup leads to higher profit share, lower growth, real wage,
wage share, utilization rate, and higher unemployment. The model
introduces two important assumptions/ideas: (1) \textbf{flexible
capacity} rate and (2) \textbf{markup pricing}.

Finally, the Kalecki-Steindl model is a good illustration of the
negative effects of the increase in industrial concentration (increase
in monopoly, decrease in competition) and that the latter can lead to
economic stagnation. Regarding the effect of an increase in propensity
to save \(s_r\), or a rise in confidence \(g_0\), the model leads to
conclusions similar (but not totally) to NKMs: a rise in \(s_r\)
(propensity to save out of profits) reduces equilibrium level of
capacity rate \(u^*\), profit rate \(r^*\), and investment \(g^*\). An
increase in \(g_0\) has the opposite effects. The difference with NKMs
is that \(u\) is affected in this Kalecki-Steindl model, but is not in
the NKMs.

In the next chapter, we will see models which are developments of this
basic Neo-Kaleckian model. More precisely, we will see that an economy
can not always be wage-led, but also profit-led or export-led when we
introduce saving propensity out of wages, change the specification of
the investment function and introduce foreign trade.
